Two electrons are transferred from NADH to FAD in the first step of the cycle, but all subsequent steps are one-electron transfers.\nResearchers were interested in observing whether Na+ has a thermodynamic effect on electron transport. Working with purified Na+-NQR from Vibrio cholerae, the researchers used spectroelectrochemistry to investigate the chemical changes that take place during electron transfer and how these changes are impacted by the presence of various cations. Na+-NQR was diluted to a final concentration of 0.75 mM in 0.150 M LiCl, NaCl, KCl, RbCl, or NH4Cl (each solution also contained redox active mediators) and placed in a glass instrument cell with CaF2 windows. The cell was equipped with two gold “grids,” which served as the working electrodes. The applied potential was varied from +200 mV to −400 mV in 20 mV increments, and a visible spectrum was recorded at each potential after waiting 40 minutes. A computer was necessary to simulate the data since the individual spectral transitions overlap. Redox transitions were assigned based on the spectroscopic changes that took place at each potential. Some of the results and assignments are presented in Table 1.\nTable 1 Midpoint Potentials of the Cofactors in Na+-NQR from V. Cholerae in the Presence of Different Cations\nCofactor Redox transition Em (mV versus SHE′)\nLi+ Na+ K+ Rb+ NH4+\nFAD FlH− ↔ Fl −235 −230 −240 −235 −230\n[2Fe-2S] [2Fe-2S]+ ↔ [2Fe-2S]2+ −300 −290 −290 −300 −300\nFMNc Fl•− ↔ Fl −150 −150 −240 −250 −240\nFMNb Fl•− ↔ Fl −140 −135 −150 −135 −135\nRiboflavin FlH•− ↔ FlH2 0 −5 −10 0 5\nNote: Fl represents flavin, the redox active center in four of the five cofactors of Na+-NQR.\nAdapted from Y.

    "question_text": "The reaction between NADH and ubiquinone is exergonic, but the reaction, when catalyzed by Na+-NQR, does not generate much heat in vivo. What factor accounts for this difference?",
    "answer_choices": "A. is more exothermic as a result of the lower activation energy.\nB. occurs sequentially in several small steps.\nC. maintains a large separation between the reacting centers.\nD. is coupled to the movement of a charged particle against a concentration gradient.",
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "your_answer": "Unknown",
    "explanation": "Solution: The correct answer is D.\nThis is impossible. Even if it were true, this would make the heat generation larger, not smaller, for the catalyzed reaction. Catalysis does not change thermodynamics.\nBy Hess's Law, the heat of reaction will sum and be the same. The fact that the reaction can be broken down into steps will not change the overall thermodynamics.\nThis is also impossible. The reactants ultimately must be close together to react.\nThe movement of a charged particle against its concentration gradient is energetically costly. Coupling the two processes: the redox reaction between NADH and ubiquinone and the movement of Na+ up a concentration gradient makes the overall process less exothermic.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "your_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Solution: The correct answer is D.\nThe strong nuclear force cannot be eliminated by increasing the temperature because this force manifests whenever nucleons are present and within a range of picometers.\nThe electrical charge is an intrinsic property of matter that is independent of temperature.\nDecreasing the density of the fuel is detrimental because the probability of fusion increases with the increase in fuel density because the attractive component of the strong nuclear force acts at short distances indicative of high density for the fuel material.\nThe probability of fusion increases with the decrease in the average distance between fuel particles that enables attractive nuclear forces to overcome the repelling nuclear forces acting at medium and long distances. An increase in the temperature is equivalent to an increase in the root-mean-square speed of the fuel particles that will travel the average distance between fuel reactants in smaller times. The associated increase in the kinetic energy of the particles relative to the center of mass of the nuclear fuel system essentially correlates with a decrease in the electrostatic potential barrier that repels particles of the same electric charge. In turn, this increases the probability of particles to undergo the tunnel effect by penetrating the electrostatic barrier. These combined effects enable reactants to approach within range of the strong nuclear force.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

    "explanation": "Solution: The correct answer is C.\nEnantiomers will not display different densities.\nThe boiling points of enantiomers are identical, and they cannot be separated by distillation.\nEnantiomers have the same physical and chemical properties. They differ only in their three dimensional arrangement of atoms and their interactions with other chiral molecules. They can differ in their smell due to interacting differently with chiral odorant receptors.\nThe IR spectra of enantiomers are identical when a normal light source is used.

This MCS precursor was isolated from plant roots through an extraction that involved mixing an aqueous emulsion with tert-butyl methyl ether ((CH3)3COCH3). After NaOH digestion, the active MCS oligomers in Figure 1 were purified on a column containing Amberlyst 15, which is a strongly acidic, neutral stationary phase. The MCS oligomer mixture was analyzed via mass spectrometry and the ratio of MCS hexamer:octamer was found to be 65:35. The most significant m/z peaks were 159.0, 295.2, 431.2, and 567.2, which were attributable to a variety of complexes between Na+ and the MCS oligomers. Membranes containing Na+/K+-ATPase were prepared, and the specific activity of pure ATPase was determined to be 2000 μmol phosphate•h−1•(mg enzyme)−1 at 37°C.

The hydroxyl group is least acidic, while the protonated amine is less acidic (pKa ~ 10) than a carboxylic acid group (pKa ~ 5). Of the two carboxylic acid groups, the one next to the chlorine atoms will be more acidic since its conjugate base (an anion) will be stabilized by an inductive effect which dissipates negative charge building up.\nA proton on alcohol is much less acidic than one in a carboxylic acid because the negative charge cannot be delocalized to several electronegative atoms.\nThis carboxylic acid proton is less acidic than the one on the left because it is not near two electronegative chlorine atoms.\nProtonated amines are less acidic than carboxylic acids (pKa of 10 versus 5).\nKhan Academy Lessons",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "your_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Solution: The correct answer is B.\nThis is smaller than the magnitude of the acceleration of the masses after they are released from rest by a factor of 1.5. It implies that only the 2-kg mass is moving after the release.\nAccording to Newton's second law, the net force acting on the 5-kg mass is given by the expression Fnet= 5 kg × a1 = 5 kg × g - T, where a1 is the acceleration after the release and T is the tension in the cord. The net force acting on the 2-kg mass is given by the expression Fnet= 2 kg × a2 = 2 kg × g - T. Because the two masses move simultaneously but in opposite directions after they are released, a1 = -a2 = a. Substituting the expression T = 5 kg × (g - a) into the equation of motion of the 2-kg mass yields -2 kg × a = 2 kg × g - 5 kg × (g - a) = -3 kg × g + 5 kg × a. Then 7 kg × a = 3 kg × g, hence a = 3g/7.\nThis is larger than the magnitude of the acceleration of the masses after they are released from rest by a factor of 1.7.

    "explanation": "Solution: The correct answer is C.\nAmplitude is a characteristic of waves, whereas photons constitute the particle description of light. Therefore, photons cannot be characterized by the property of amplitude.\nThe energy of a photon is given by the relationship E = hc/l. If E is doubled, then wavelength l is halved not doubled.\nThe energy of a photon is given by the relationship E = hf. If E is doubled, then frequency f is doubled, too, as Planck's constant h does not change.\nIntensity is a characteristic of waves, whereas photons constitute the particle description of light.

These lines had wavelengths of 410 nm, 434 nm, 486 nm, and 656 nm, where 1 nm = 10–9 m. This series of lines is part of what became known as the Balmer series, after Johann Balmer demonstrated that their wavelengths λ could be described by the equation\nAlthough this equation worked, it was some time before scientists understood why it worked.\nIn the early 1900s, Niels Bohr proposed that the electron in a hydrogen atom could exist only in certain quantized energy states. These states were given by the equation E = –13.6/n2 eV. He further proposed that when an electron moved from a higher energy state to a lower one, the excess energy was released as a packet, or quantum, of light known as a photon. The corresponding wavelength of a photon could then be found with the equation λ = hc/E, where E is the energy of the photon, h = 4.1 × 10–15 eV•s is Planck’s constant, and c = 3 × 108 m/s is the speed of light.

    "correct_answer": "A",

    "explanation": "Solution: The correct answer is A.\nThe author emphasizes that the beauty and appeal of a project before it results in the creation of a physical object is the project's quality as an imaginative fiction under the control of the engineer. The author also associates this conceptual stage with language and symbols: \"In this stage of signs, language, and text, people influence the object\" (paragraph 4). This suggests that, in the conceptual stage, it is best not to respond to the project as if it were a fixed object that already exists. For instance, the author compares the project to \"A fiction with a variable structure\" and states that \"it is this flexibility to which we must aspire in tracking a technological project\" (final paragraph).\nThe tendency described in the question prompt conflicts with the distinction the author makes between the hypotheses of scientists and the proposals of engineers. The author suggests that the physical sciences describe an already existing reality; in contrast, engineering creates objects that do not yet exist and thus have an unknown potential.\nThe author refers to \"unhonored\" engineers only figuratively, to suggest that engineers have a far greater role in contributing to culture and history than is often acknowledged: \"Only a fiction [i.e., a project] that is capable of gaining or losing reality can do justice to engineers, those great unhonored figures of culture and history\" (final paragraph).

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "your_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Solution: The correct answer is B.\nThe purpose of the contrast is not to suggest that natural designs follow variable paths while technology follows linear paths. Instead, the contrast is used to illustrate that the scientist's objects of study existed before discovery while the engineer's did not. The author states that \"few would seriously defend the proposition that the diesel engine had always existed and needed only to be discovered\" by Diesel (paragraph 2), while in contrast it is clear that the orbit of Venus existed before its discovery by Galileo.\nThe contrast supports the author's belief that, while science explains the nature of already existing objects and phenomena, engineering is by contrast creative since through it entirely new objects are created. In this way, the orbit of Venus is predetermined and only discovered while the design of the diesel engine is creative. The author states that \"few would seriously defend the proposition that the diesel engine had always existed and needed only to be discovered\" (paragraph 2) in the way that the orbit of the planet Venus had to be discovered.\nAlthough the author does mention that engineers work with scientific principles, this is not the purpose of the contrast between Diesel and Galileo: \"One might argue, of course, that Diesel did not create the principles he applied in his engine any more than Galileo created the astronomical principles he observed, and some would even contend that the engine was therefore as much beyond the control of Diesel as Venus was beyond the control of Galileo. Even so, few would seriously defend the proposition that the diesel engine had always existed and needed only to be discovered\" (paragraph 2). Instead, the contrast shows that Galileo's discoveries revealed already existing phenomena while Diesel designed objects that did not previously exist.\nThe author does point out that the design of the diesel engine followed known principles: \"One might argue, of course, that Diesel did not create the principles he applied in his engine any more than Galileo created the astronomical principles he observed, and some would even contend that the engine was therefore as much beyond the control of Diesel as Venus was beyond the control of Galileo\" (paragraph 2).

    "passage": "Passage 2 (Questions 8-14)\nThe prevailing approach to improving population health emphasizes “shifting the mean” through prevention efforts that target large groups at high risk for particular conditions, or through mass interventions that encourage small but universal changes in individual behavior. This approach encourages the search for “blockbuster” public health interventions that can have the largest effects on determinants of population health and individual behavior.\nNew business models, however, demonstrate that selling small quantities of many “niche” items can be more profitable than selling a few blockbuster items. In The Long Tail, Chris Anderson argues that niche markets—subsets of consumers interested in particular products—are more accessible today than ever, and that although the demand for any particular niche-focused product will be limited, there are so many niches that together these products make up a huge market. He mentions a large online bookstore, in which half of the top 10,000 books sold less than one copy per quarter.\nUnderstanding how and why businesses profit from this “long tail” of niche products (in other words, focusing on consumers at the ends of the distribution curve) has the potential to transform our thinking about strategies to improve public health. Health messages can be thought of as products targeted to specific subgroups of the population, many of which bear a disproportionate burden of disease because of heightened exposure to risk or unequal access to beneficial or health-promoting resources. Such population subgroups might include some racial and/or ethnic minorities, populations with low income, and those without health insurance. Focusing on vulnerable populations could work to complement, rather than replace, a population approach.\nThe number and complexity of niche markets increase exponentially when we consider how certain illnesses and preventive services affect different population subgroups, with different constellations of demographic, geographic, and health status risk factors. Approaches might be targeted to groups as diverse as migrant farmworkers in rural communities, parents of children with asthma, and Alaskan natives aged 50 years and older. Creating effective, tailored health resources for this near-infinite number of combinations of subgroups and health issues is a daunting task. Traditionally, local organizations have created resources targeted to particular users, but they are unlikely to have the kind of funding, capacity, and infrastructure that larger organizations do. Furthermore, because there are few mechanisms for efficient sharing among niche-serving organizations, duplication is bound to occur. One study identified 116 different types of printed cancer education materials that targeted African Americans.\nThe Internet has been invaluable in facilitating the distribution of niche products, making it easy for consumers to find niche products through the use of filters, recommendation systems, and ratings. The opportunity to sample an unfamiliar product before buying it—to read a chapter from a book, for instance—lowers the consumer risk. Finally, the ability to customize a product to a user’s needs or preferences can increase its appeal.\nIn order to create health communication materials targeted to specific populations, organizations can take advantage of Internet-based resources. The Make It Your Own (MIYO) system is an online tool that helps users create health communication materials for the specific populations they serve. Users “build” materials by choosing from a menu of evidence-based approaches recommended by the Guide to Community Preventive Services, then customize them by choosing from a library of images, messages, and graphic designs. MIYO renders their creations into electronic documents that can be printed, e-mailed, texted, used online, or distributed in other ways to target audiences. This approach might work as well for other evidence-based public health solutions, such as campaigns, social marketing, behavioral interventions, or worksite and/or school-based programs.\nAdapted from M.

This approach encourages the search for “blockbuster” public health interventions that can have the largest effects on determinants of population health and individual behavior.\nNew business models, however, demonstrate that selling small quantities of many “niche” items can be more profitable than selling a few blockbuster items. In The Long Tail, Chris Anderson argues that niche markets—subsets of consumers interested in particular products—are more accessible today than ever, and that although the demand for any particular niche-focused product will be limited, there are so many niches that together these products make up a huge market. He mentions a large online bookstore, in which half of the top 10,000 books sold less than one copy per quarter.\nUnderstanding how and why businesses profit from this “long tail” of niche products (in other words, focusing on consumers at the ends of the distribution curve) has the potential to transform our thinking about strategies to improve public health. Health messages can be thought of as products targeted to specific subgroups of the population, many of which bear a disproportionate burden of disease because of heightened exposure to risk or unequal access to beneficial or health-promoting resources. Such population subgroups might include some racial and/or ethnic minorities, populations with low income, and those without health insurance. Focusing on vulnerable populations could work to complement, rather than replace, a population approach.\nThe number and complexity of niche markets increase exponentially when we consider how certain illnesses and preventive services affect different population subgroups, with different constellations of demographic, geographic, and health status risk factors. Approaches might be targeted to groups as diverse as migrant farmworkers in rural communities, parents of children with asthma, and Alaskan natives aged 50 years and older. Creating effective, tailored health resources for this near-infinite number of combinations of subgroups and health issues is a daunting task. Traditionally, local organizations have created resources targeted to particular users, but they are unlikely to have the kind of funding, capacity, and infrastructure that larger organizations do. Furthermore, because there are few mechanisms for efficient sharing among niche-serving organizations, duplication is bound to occur.

While this theory is not incorrect, it is incomplete. Cities are indeed filled with the modern-day equivalent of the luftmenschen (the term translates from Yiddish as people who “lived on air”). In many sectors of the “creative industry,” however, there comes a point when something tangible must be produced, and when, because of financial or time constraints, it makes sense to have it produced locally. Locating manufacturing close to the site of creation is not simply a matter of convenience; the process of production can inform and shape the creative process itself.\nEven as New York City was gaining in stature as a fashion capital in the latter half of the twentieth century, however, its share of U.S. garment production declined from a commanding 90 percent to less than 10 percent. Rodger Cohen, second-generation owner of Regal Originals, identifies himself as the only unionized pleater left in the city; in the 1980s, there were 400 of them. Although this development resulted from a complex mixture of forces, suffice it to say that advances in communications and transportation diminished New York City’s inherent geographic advantage in manufacturing.\nThe question, then, is not so much why the garment industry in New York City has shrunk, but rather why there continues to be a garment district at all. In asking this question, we might as well be asking why cities continue to exist. “If we postulate only the usual economic forces,” observed economist Robert Lucas, “cities should fly apart.” Why would young designers live in New York when they could live more comfortably in other cities with much lower costs of living? The answer is that people come to be near other people—to draw upon their expertise, to exchange ideas, to compete. Firms locate near one another to gain a sense of what the competition is doing, to hire talent, and to benefit from the kind of concentrated presence that offers one-stop shopping to out-of-town buyers.\nSo the reason a city like New York still thrives, even after losing most of its industrial base, argues Richard Florida, is that economic success “no longer revolves around simply making and moving things.” Instead, he writes, “it depends on generating and transporting ideas.” Just as neuroscientists speculate that higher intelligence correlates with the number of network connections between neurons in the brain and the speed with which they communicate, the cities that function best are those with the “highest velocity” of ideas, and the most efficient and robust links between people. The service suppliers of the garment district act as an informal incubator. That word may conjure gleaming office parks more than it does old buildings with questionable elevators, but the end result is the same. The loss of even a single fabric supplier, like a ripple in a pond, is felt everywhere.\nCreativity in fashion, as in any art, can originate anywhere: from a splash of color on a billboard to a new stitch. It is not surprising that cities tend to be hubs of creativity—there are more things and people to be inspired by, more knowledge transfer, and, importantly, more ways to make creative ideas into reality. Urban planners should not necessarily try to preserve a specific industry, but to enable the seedbeds that help create and sustain an empire of images and aura such as New York City’s fashion industry.\nAdapted from T.

The author clearly implies that the decline in union membership is an effect of the shrinking of the garment district, not a cause of that shrinking.\nAlthough this is a plausible claim, the point of mentioning Cohen is to describe the decline in number of fashion-oriented business in the city, not to make the point suggested in this option.\nThe author writes: \"Even as New York City was gaining in stature as a fashion capital in the latter half of the 20th century, however, its share of U.S. garment production underwent a full-tilt inversion, from a commanding 90 percent to less than 10 percent; Rodger Cohen, the second-generation owner of Regal Originals, identifies himself as the only unionized pleater left in the city; in the 1980s, there were 400 of them\".

Locating manufacturing close to the site of creation is not simply a matter of convenience; the process of production can inform and shape the creative process itself.\nEven as New York City was gaining in stature as a fashion capital in the latter half of the twentieth century, however, its share of U.S. garment production declined from a commanding 90 percent to less than 10 percent. Rodger Cohen, second-generation owner of Regal Originals, identifies himself as the only unionized pleater left in the city; in the 1980s, there were 400 of them. Although this development resulted from a complex mixture of forces, suffice it to say that advances in communications and transportation diminished New York City’s inherent geographic advantage in manufacturing.\nThe question, then, is not so much why the garment industry in New York City has shrunk, but rather why there continues to be a garment district at all. In asking this question, we might as well be asking why cities continue to exist. “If we postulate only the usual economic forces,” observed economist Robert Lucas, “cities should fly apart.” Why would young designers live in New York when they could live more comfortably in other cities with much lower costs of living? The answer is that people come to be near other people—to draw upon their expertise, to exchange ideas, to compete. Firms locate near one another to gain a sense of what the competition is doing, to hire talent, and to benefit from the kind of concentrated presence that offers one-stop shopping to out-of-town buyers.\nSo the reason a city like New York still thrives, even after losing most of its industrial base, argues Richard Florida, is that economic success “no longer revolves around simply making and moving things.” Instead, he writes, “it depends on generating and transporting ideas.” Just as neuroscientists speculate that higher intelligence correlates with the number of network connections between neurons in the brain and the speed with which they communicate, the cities that function best are those with the “highest velocity” of ideas, and the most efficient and robust links between people. The service suppliers of the garment district act as an informal incubator. That word may conjure gleaming office parks more than it does old buildings with questionable elevators, but the end result is the same. The loss of even a single fabric supplier, like a ripple in a pond, is felt everywhere.\nCreativity in fashion, as in any art, can originate anywhere: from a splash of color on a billboard to a new stitch. It is not surprising that cities tend to be hubs of creativity—there are more things and people to be inspired by, more knowledge transfer, and, importantly, more ways to make creative ideas into reality. Urban planners should not necessarily try to preserve a specific industry, but to enable the seedbeds that help create and sustain an empire of images and aura such as New York City’s fashion industry.\nAdapted from T. Vanderbilt, “Long Live the Industrial City ©2011 Wilson Quarterly.",
    "question_text": "Based on the passage, what does Robert Lucas most likely mean by the \"usual economic forces\" (paragraph 3)?",

The author goes on immediately to ask, “why would young designers live in New York when they could live more comfortably in other cities with much lower costs of living?” The implication is that this question describes the usual economic forces at work, which, in this case, would be the forces that prioritize the tangible items or circumstances (leading to comfort) that one can get for one’s money.\nLucas is talking about the effects cost of living may have on people’s choices about where to live, not about the factors that themselves influence cost of living.\nThere is no discussion in relation to Lucas's claim about any preference people might display for the \"newest\" or the \"most valuable\" items, so this option is simply not supported.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

    "passage": "Passage 4 (Questions 22-26)\nMany blues musicians in the United States, particularly artists who grew up in the South during the first half of the twentieth century, experienced economic and other challenges and are often depicted as struggling artists with limited resources. At first glance, the Delta Blues Museum in Clarksdale, MS, seems not to portray blues artists in this conventional way. For instance, one exhibit chronicling the history of the blues includes a picture of Robert Johnson holding an acoustic guitar and wearing a fashionable pinstripe suit with a handkerchief neatly tucked in the front pocket. One of only two surviving photographs of Johnson, the picture was taken in a professional studio. The museum even contains a life-size mannequin of Muddy Waters dressed in an immaculate white suit and holding an expensive Gibson electric guitar. Beyond these visual representations of the artists as well-dressed and successful musicians, brief narratives from blues experts acknowledge the musicians’ important contributions to American popular culture.\nUpon closer examination, however, these symbols of success are overshadowed by the museum’s concerted efforts to construct what many people perceive as more “authentic” images of blues musicians. This strategy takes various forms. First, examples of blues artists’ material struggles abound in the collection. In a memorial to Big Joe Williams, the guitarist is pictured playing his guitar on his porch. Although Williams is the focal point of the picture, the deteriorating porch and exterior wall, along with what appears to be a dirt driveway, suggest the musician’s limited means.\nThere are also a number of tattered instruments on display. Many of the exhibit’s acoustic guitars, for example, are disfigured, reflecting the difficult and uncompromising lives of their former owners. The wooden body of Big Joe Williams’s guitar, for example, is filled with scratches and nicks, the frets are worn, and the finish on the guitar neck is missing in several places, revealing a black undercoat. Visitors will also find well-used harmonicas and percussion instruments protected in a glass display case. Although technically “silent,” the instruments play a song of the artist’s history, craft, struggle, and legacy. While one cannot deny that many of these musicians were forced to survive in a world of poverty and grueling, labor-intensive employment, it is also true that some blues musicians, including B.B. King, Buddy Guy, Robert Cray, and others, amassed considerable personal fortunes.\nThe museum’s exhibits are constructed to satisfy the expectations of tourists who seek out images of what they perceive as an authentic blues culture. This display strategy not only works to legitimize and reinforce the image of the authentic blues singer, it also embodies larger marketing and promotional strategies designed to perpetuate the romantic vision of the Mississippi Delta as the mythical birthplace of the blues. For many blues tourists, the Delta serves as the last bastion of an authentic blues culture apparently untainted by the more commercial aspects of marketing and tourism.\nDespite this perception, several Southern states are capitalizing on the popularity of the blues and the potential financial windfall generated from tourists. According to ethnomusicologist Jeff Todd Titon, recent efforts reflect the “new blues tourism,” an organized attempt to create a mediated experience for tourists ironically seeking an “authentic” and “genuine” blues experience. The new blues tourism is an example of niche tourism that capitalizes on the efforts of communities to accentuate their cultural heritage in an effort to increase their revenue from tourism as an industry.\nAdapted from S.A.

    "passage": "Passage 5 (Questions 27-32)\nThe migration of Vietnam-era American draft and military resisters to Canada began as a trickle in the mid-1960s and grew into a fast-flowing stream by the end of the decade. Just over 100 resisters, known more commonly as “draft dodgers” and “deserters,” came to Canada in 1964. By 1965, the number was more than ten times that. Over 3,000 resisters came in 1967; from 5,000 to 8,000 came yearly through 1973. These were just the men. More women than men came, most as partners and spouses, and some on their own.

    "passage": "Passage 6 (Questions 33-38)\nOccupational stress has been recognized as one of the most significant workplace health hazards for employees in the United States and other developed countries. In the short term, stress can lead to emotional distress, stomach disorder, headaches, sleeplessness, and loss of energy; in the long term, it can contribute to serious illness and even premature death, most likely due to cardiovascular disease. Occupational stress costs U.S. businesses more than $150 billion per year because of absence, lost productivity, and health costs. Furthermore, occupational stress seems to be endemic to the modern workplace, as surveys have shown that a large proportion of workers report feeling highly stressed at work.\nThere are a number of workplace factors, called job stressors, that make jobs stressful. Some stressors concern the nature of the job and job tasks. For example, jobs with heavy workloads requiring long periods of attention and jobs that are highly repetitive and boring will likely be perceived as stressful. Other stressors concern interpersonal relationships at work, such as conflicts with co-workers or abusive behavior by supervisors. Finally, there are stressors in the organizational context, such as having insufficient resources to do the job or unfair payment systems.\nOne of the most important factors in determining the level of occupational stress experienced is the perception of control. Control can be over any aspect of work, including location, scheduling, and how tasks are done. Jobs differ tremendously in the amount and type of control they allow employees. At one extreme is factory work in which the employee must work at precisely determined times, performing specified tasks at intervals determined by a machine. At the other extreme are high-level management positions in which tasks can be done at any place, at any time, and in almost any manner employees see fit.\nThroughout the workday, employees experience and perceive conditions and events, most of which are typically benign and paid little attention. Certain events, however, are perceived and interpreted as somehow threatening to physical or psychological well-being—these are the perceived job stressors. The stressors result in negative emotional reactions, perhaps most commonly anger or anxiety. These emotions lead to strains, both behaviors and physical conditions associated with stress. Perceived control is an important element at all stages of this process.\nJob stressors can include anything that a person finds threatening, including the amount of work and work demands, constraints that interfere with work or prevent employees from getting their work done, interpersonal conflicts among employees, and uncertainty about tasks. Behavioral strains consist of actions people take to cope with stressors and the associated emotions. They can be constructive acts that successfully deal with stressors or acts that are destructive to the individual and the employer. Physical strains are related to both the fatigue of hard work and the physiology of negative emotion. Both kinds of physical strains can increase physiological arousal, resulting in elevated blood pressure and heart rate, as well as secretion of so-called stress hormones, such as adrenaline, into the bloodstream. In the short term, such physiological changes can result in minor physical symptoms, such as headache or upset stomach. Chronic elevation of heart rate and blood pressure can contribute to more serious health conditions and ultimately heart disease in some individuals.\nCompared with individuals who perceive they have low control, individuals who perceive they have high control will be less likely to interpret the environment as stressful, will have lower negative emotional responses, and will exhibit less strain.\nAdapted from P.

    "correct_answer": "C",

    "explanation": "Solution: The correct answer is C.\nThe author defines occupational stressors, or job stressors as \"anything that a person finds threatening, including the amount of work and work demands, constraints that interfere with work or prevent employees from getting their work done, interpersonal conflicts among employees, and uncertainty about tasks\" (paragraph 5). The employee's heavy smoking would be a behavioral response to the occupational stressor, not a stressor of the job itself.\nThe author explains that the employee's degree of \"perceived control\" over any aspect of work affects their level of stress (paragraph 3). But the author does not describe actions as \"buffers between control and stress,\" nor is there any reason to believe that smoking would function in this way.\nThe author explains that \"Behavioral strains consist of actions people take to cope with stressors and the associated emotions. They can be constructive acts . . . or acts that are destructive to the individual and the employer\" (paragraph 5). As heavy smoking is clearly harmful to the individual, and potentially to their employer, if they become sick, and is often used as a coping behavior,\" the smoking would be an example of a destructive behavioral strain.\nBecause heavy smoking is very well-known to present serious health risks, calling this behavior a \"constructive coping behavior\" is highly implausible.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "your_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Solution: The correct answer is D.\nThe author explains that workers who perceive that they have a high degree of control at work experience less stress: \"Compared with individuals who perceive they have low control, individuals who perceive they have high control will be less likely to interpret the environment as stressful. . .\" (final paragraph). A businessman who has no say in \"all major decisions,\" then, would have relatively low control and relatively high stress.\nThe author contends that the degree of control an employee perceives they exercise at work is a very important factor in determining their level of stress (final paragraph). If a soldier's \"daily routine\" is controlled by superiors, that soldier will have lower perceived control and therefore higher stress.\nThe author writes: \"One of the most important factors in determining the level of occupational stress experienced is the perception of control\" (paragraph 3). The final paragraph explains that more control results in less stress, relative to a person with lower control. Thus, a patient who has no control over their medical decisions would be likely to exhibit significant stress.\nThe author writes that \"Compared with individuals who perceive they have low control, individuals who perceive they have high control will be less likely to interpret the environment as stressful . . .\" (final paragraph).

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "your_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Solution: The correct answer is B.\nThe author argues that employees who perceive that they have high control \"will be less likely to interpret the environment as stressful\" (final paragraph). This is not the same as saying that these people are particularly likely to engage in \"constructive\" acts in reaction to the stress that they do perceive or to deal \"successfully\" with stress. The author's statement only speaks to the degree of stress that these people are likely to experience.\nAbout employees' reaction to or interpretation of events, the author writes: Throughout the workday, employees experience and perceive conditions and events, most of which are . . . paid little attention. Certain events, however, are perceived and interpreted as somehow threatening to physical or psychological well-being—these are the perceived job stressors\" (paragraph 4). About the effect of control on interpretation, the author writes: \"individuals who perceive they have high control will be less likely to interpret the environment as stressful\"(final paragraph). Thus, it can be inferred that people who perceive they have a high degree of control, will be less likely to perceive or understand events around them as stressful, or threatening to their well-being.\nIn paragraph 2, the author describes a whole range of \"workplace factors\" that can make jobs stressful. These include \"stressors in the organizational context\" (paragraph 2), but the author indicates that high perceived control (as described in the question) is likely to be correlated with lower, rather than higher, stress. And further, the question does not provide any information that would suggest that any stress the described person would experience would likely be \"related to the organizational context\" of their jobs.\nTo the contrary, the author suggests that people in management are more likely to have high perceived control over their workplaces: At the other extreme [from workers with very little control] are high-level management positions in which tasks can be done at any place, at any time, and in almost any manner employees see fit\" (paragraph 3).

    "your_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Solution: The correct answer is A.\nThe author maintains that the degree of perceived control that an employee exercises over aspects of their work environment is directly linked to their experience of occupational stress, with higher levels of control corresponding to lower levels of stress (final paragraph). The author also presents \"high-level management positions\" as positions in which employees typically exert significant control over their work, because their \"tasks can be done at any place, at any time, and in almost any manner employees see fit\" (paragraph 3). Thus, if these very high-level management employees were experiencing higher levels of stress than factory workers, whose work the author describes as providing little control and significant stress (their jobs are likely include heavy workloads requiring long periods of attention and [may be]. . highly repetitive and boring\"(paragraph 3), then the author's explanation of the process of occupational stress would clearly be weakened.\nThe author treats occupational stress as a serious problem, writing that \"occupational stress has been recognized as one of the most significant workplace health hazards for employees in the United States and other developed countries\" (first paragraph), so the statistics provided in this option would strengthen the author's viewpoint, not weaken it.\nThe author talks about occupational stress in terms of the employee's perception of risk or threat: \"Certain events . . .are perceived and interpreted as somehow threatening to physical or psychological well-being—these are the perceived job stressors\" (paragraph 4). In the passage analysis, it is perceived threat that produces stress, and that stress creates challenges for the employee regardless of whether or not the threat is \"actually\" real. In fact, the stress itself is described as creating threats to the employee's well-being: \"The stressors result in negative emotional reactions, perhaps most commonly anger or anxiety\" (paragraph 4). Thus, whether or not something is \"interpreted\" correctly as a threat by the employee is irrelevant to the author's argument and does not weaken it; the argument is about perception of threat as it produces stress.\nThe author describes a range of types of occupational stressors in paragraph 2 and includes both stressors that occur in the \"organizational context\" of a workplace and those involving interpersonal relationships at work. The author does not make a comparison about the relative degree of stress that either type of stress creates and thus the information in this option would not weaken the author's claims.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

Chronic elevation of heart rate and blood pressure can contribute to more serious health conditions and ultimately heart disease in some individuals.\"\nThe author makes this claim in the first paragraph, but offers no evidence to support it; it is simply an assertion.\nThe author makes this claim in the first paragraph, but again simply asserts the claim, rather than offering any evidence to support it.

    "passage": "Passage 6 (Questions 33-38)\nOccupational stress has been recognized as one of the most significant workplace health hazards for employees in the United States and other developed countries. In the short term, stress can lead to emotional distress, stomach disorder, headaches, sleeplessness, and loss of energy; in the long term, it can contribute to serious illness and even premature death, most likely due to cardiovascular disease. Occupational stress costs U.S. businesses more than $150 billion per year because of absence, lost productivity, and health costs. Furthermore, occupational stress seems to be endemic to the modern workplace, as surveys have shown that a large proportion of workers report feeling highly stressed at work.\nThere are a number of workplace factors, called job stressors, that make jobs stressful. Some stressors concern the nature of the job and job tasks. For example, jobs with heavy workloads requiring long periods of attention and jobs that are highly repetitive and boring will likely be perceived as stressful. Other stressors concern interpersonal relationships at work, such as conflicts with co-workers or abusive behavior by supervisors. Finally, there are stressors in the organizational context, such as having insufficient resources to do the job or unfair payment systems.\nOne of the most important factors in determining the level of occupational stress experienced is the perception of control. Control can be over any aspect of work, including location, scheduling, and how tasks are done. Jobs differ tremendously in the amount and type of control they allow employees. At one extreme is factory work in which the employee must work at precisely determined times, performing specified tasks at intervals determined by a machine. At the other extreme are high-level management positions in which tasks can be done at any place, at any time, and in almost any manner employees see fit.\nThroughout the workday, employees experience and perceive conditions and events, most of which are typically benign and paid little attention. Certain events, however, are perceived and interpreted as somehow threatening to physical or psychological well-being—these are the perceived job stressors. The stressors result in negative emotional reactions, perhaps most commonly anger or anxiety. These emotions lead to strains, both behaviors and physical conditions associated with stress. Perceived control is an important element at all stages of this process.\nJob stressors can include anything that a person finds threatening, including the amount of work and work demands, constraints that interfere with work or prevent employees from getting their work done, interpersonal conflicts among employees, and uncertainty about tasks. Behavioral strains consist of actions people take to cope with stressors and the associated emotions. They can be constructive acts that successfully deal with stressors or acts that are destructive to the individual and the employer. Physical strains are related to both the fatigue of hard work and the physiology of negative emotion. Both kinds of physical strains can increase physiological arousal, resulting in elevated blood pressure and heart rate, as well as secretion of so-called stress hormones, such as adrenaline, into the bloodstream. In the short term, such physiological changes can result in minor physical symptoms, such as headache or upset stomach. Chronic elevation of heart rate and blood pressure can contribute to more serious health conditions and ultimately heart disease in some individuals.\nCompared with individuals who perceive they have low control, individuals who perceive they have high control will be less likely to interpret the environment as stressful, will have lower negative emotional responses, and will exhibit less strain.\nAdapted from P. E. Spector, “Employee Control and Occupational Stress.” ©2002 American Psychological Society.",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "your_answer": "Unknown",
    "explanation": "Solution: The correct answer is C.\nThe passage discusses absences from work as a possible result of occupational stress (first paragraph), which the author explains can result from an employee's perception of threats to their well-being. The passage does not suggest that missing work without a reason would be an example of a perceived threat to an employee's well-being.\nThe example given in this option would be an example of a physical, rather than a psychological strain. The author writes: \"Physical strains are related to . . . the fatigue of hard work\" (paragraph 5).\nThe author describes a number of different types of job stressors: \"Other stressors concern interpersonal relationships at work, such as conflicts with co-workers or abusive behavior by supervisors\" (paragraph 2). This would be an example of a perceived threat to an employee's \"psychological well-being,\" rather than to the \"physical well-being,\" a distinction that is made in paragraph 2.\nThe author says that \"constraints that interfere with work\" (paragraph 5) can produce or cause stress for employees, but this is not the same as saying that employees deliberately doing work slowly or incorrectly would be an example of a perceived threat to psychological well-being.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

    "passage": "Passage 7 (Questions 39-43)\nThe “auteur theory” of film and its champions emerged in post-World War II France when a group of young film enthusiasts encountered a deluge of Hollywood cinema (embargoed for part of the war) and expressed dissatisfaction with what they saw as a banal tradition in French cinema. At its heart, auteur theory contends that the director of a film is its “author.”\nFilmmaker and writer Alexandre Astruc’s influential 1948 article, “La Camera-Stylo” (or “The Camera-Pen”) challenged cinema’s reliance on literature as its primary source of storytelling. Astruc was convinced that cinema would replace the novel, but believed that cinema must first become more like the novel, in that filmmakers could express their obsessions and thoughts, even abstract ones, at the level of profundity and significance of an essay or novel.\nAstruc’s notion of the cinematic auteur resonated strongly with the younger director and critic Francois Truffaut, who argued for a new French cinema grounded in radical and political impulses that he believed only a true auteur could provide. Truffaut’s 1953 manifesto for a new French cinema reiterated Astruc’s stylistic emphasis: the cinematic is expressed by the visual elements in a film (known to scholars as mise-en-scene), not the literary word. Film scholar John Caughie argues that “the attention to mise-en-scene…is probably the most important contribution of [auteur theory] to the development of a precise and detailed film criticism, engaging with the specific mechanisms of visual discourse, freeing it from literary models, and from the liberal commitments which were prepared to validate films on the basis of their themes alone.” In Truffaut’s view, Jean Renoir, Robert Bresson, Jean Cocteau, and others were the great French auteurs who created a cinema in the spirit of the other arts, yet pure in its own specific properties.\nWhat about Hollywood? If the auteur in European cinema was readily identifiable as an artist of integrity and therefore produced a complete work of art, it was because these directors were afforded the opportunity to work outside of a strict studio environment. Is it possible for the auteur to be identified in the great factory-produced art of America? As far as American film critic Andrew Sarris was concerned, the answer was definitively yes. If the French recognized the importance of Hollywood directors, why were American critics unable to see their contributions? Yet to make the case that popular culture and mass-produced art was worthy of critical discussion was no easy matter.\nSarris sought to bring critical analysis to Hollywood cinema against a background of critical condescension. To do this, he identified the film’s director as the criterion of value and opposed the contemporary practice of film criticism that relied on reviewing the star, screenwriter, and/or producer. Sarris established a set of evaluative criteria to determine the worth of the American director as auteur. These included technical competence, the presence of a distinct visual style, and the emergence of “interior meaning,” which, Sarris maintained, arose from the tension between the director and the conditions of production within which the director worked (the system of film studios in Hollywood, CA). Clearly, Sarris’s methodology slipped dangerously into overly subjective analysis. His goal, however, in “Toward a Theory of Film History,” was to shake film criticism out of its resistance to engage with Hollywood cinema. Foreign films, documentaries, and avant-garde or experimental films were not morally superior.\nEd Buscombe recommends that critics study three factors to create alternatives to the auteur approach: the effects of cinema on society; the effects of society (including ideology, economics, and technology) on cinema; and the effects of films on other films.\nAdapted from D.A.

Film scholar John Caughie argues that “the attention to mise-en-scene…is probably the most important contribution of [auteur theory] to the development of a precise and detailed film criticism, engaging with the specific mechanisms of visual discourse, freeing it from literary models, and from the liberal commitments which were prepared to validate films on the basis of their themes alone.” In Truffaut’s view, Jean Renoir, Robert Bresson, Jean Cocteau, and others were the great French auteurs who created a cinema in the spirit of the other arts, yet pure in its own specific properties.\nWhat about Hollywood? If the auteur in European cinema was readily identifiable as an artist of integrity and therefore produced a complete work of art, it was because these directors were afforded the opportunity to work outside of a strict studio environment. Is it possible for the auteur to be identified in the great factory-produced art of America? As far as American film critic Andrew Sarris was concerned, the answer was definitively yes. If the French recognized the importance of Hollywood directors, why were American critics unable to see their contributions? Yet to make the case that popular culture and mass-produced art was worthy of critical discussion was no easy matter.\nSarris sought to bring critical analysis to Hollywood cinema against a background of critical condescension. To do this, he identified the film’s director as the criterion of value and opposed the contemporary practice of film criticism that relied on reviewing the star, screenwriter, and/or producer. Sarris established a set of evaluative criteria to determine the worth of the American director as auteur. These included technical competence, the presence of a distinct visual style, and the emergence of “interior meaning,” which, Sarris maintained, arose from the tension between the director and the conditions of production within which the director worked (the system of film studios in Hollywood, CA). Clearly, Sarris’s methodology slipped dangerously into overly subjective analysis. His goal, however, in “Toward a Theory of Film History,” was to shake film criticism out of its resistance to engage with Hollywood cinema. Foreign films, documentaries, and avant-garde or experimental films were not morally superior.\nEd Buscombe recommends that critics study three factors to create alternatives to the auteur approach: the effects of cinema on society; the effects of society (including ideology, economics, and technology) on cinema; and the effects of films on other films.\nAdapted from D.A.

    "passage": "Passage 8 (Questions 44-48)\nIn the 1890s French artist Claude Monet devoted most of his time to painting the same subject, again and again, often from the exact same position—but in different kinds of light and in different seasons. These works were first exhibited together as each group was completed, and many of Monet’s admirers at the time hoped—as Monet himself did—that some of the series could be kept together. Instead they were sold to collectors all over the world, a dispersion that evokes the breaking up and scattering of the panels of so many Renaissance altarpieces. Monet’s series works were never exhibited together again in quantity until a 1990 exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago.\nHanging at right angles to each other in a corner of that exhibition were two paintings of Norway’s Mount Kolsaas, one of which is unfinished. A comparison of the two helps us to see what makes these paintings magical. While the unfinished picture is immediately pleasing, one needs to turn to the finished picture to find a surface swarming with tiny details, each related to the others in a kind of organic interdependence.\nIt is because this work lives in such details that the paintings’ deepest beauty does not survive in reproductions; the work must be seen up close, slowly, canvas by canvas. Viewed this way, the surface of each painting suggests a wealth of inner movement, as the eye progresses from one tiny colored splotch or line to the next, as if viewing some mysterious microscopic living world.\nYet there is much more than sensual pleasure here. As is the case with a number of other nineteenth- and early twentieth-century paintings, each work contains a knot of paradoxes. The physical world is present in these paintings with stunning immediacy. But at the same time, one cannot resist the feeling that each work is as carefully arranged, composed, and synthetically created as the gardens Monet cultivated at his home in Giverny. The overall compositions are often very simple, yet they seem carefully selected and perfectly balanced—too perfect to be an accident of nature.\nA related paradox can also be found not only in Monet’s work, but in the work of a number of his contemporaries, particularly Cezanne. These artists apply paint in varying degrees of thickness to produce relief effects. This slight three-dimensionality heightens the viewer’s sense of the physicality of the object depicted, while making it even more apparent that one is viewing pigment.\nWe live in a culture cluttered with objects, with a surfeit of media noise and a glut of images that encourage only the most superficial visual impressions. If seen with care, Monet’s work can help inspire a renewed vision. Rather than offering us wall decorations whose effects never change, he offers us pictures that have some of the completeness, complexity, and mutability of a living being. To those who perceive all else on our planet in hierarchical terms, Monet offers images that represent all parts of the world, from trees to rocks to the polluted smoke over London, as equally alive. To a civilization whose hypertrophied industrialization is steadily breaking down all the life-producing interconnections nature built up over millions of years, he offers an image of birds, boats, cliffs, sky, air, and light as all part of the same ecosystem. Indeed, it would not be going too far to say that these works offer a genuinely ecological vision.\nAdapted from F. Camper, An Ecological Vision: Monet in the 90s. ©1990 the Author.",

    "passage": "Passage 9 (Questions 49-53)\nThe period during which the romantic sensibility was created and came to dominate English poetry (roughly, 1775–1910) was the period that ushered in modern times. During it, England was industrialized; political power shifted within the nation; and scientific rationalism became increasingly important and influential. By 1800, a workable steam engine had been perfected.

    "question_text": "Passage information suggests that novels during the romantic era were focused on:",
    "answer_choices": "A. shifting toward more spiritual and imaginative topics.\nB. resolving the psychological problems of the authors.\nC. espousing the new, more scientific ideas of the age.\nD. navigating a revolutionary and changing world.",
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "your_answer": "Unknown",
    "explanation": "Solution: The correct answer is D.\nThe author describes the poets (not the novelists) of the industrial age in Britain as the writers who reacted against the radical changes of the period with a shift in the direction of \"spiritual and imaginative\" topics. The author writes of the period's poets: \"to animalism they opposed the spirit; to rationalism, the creative imagination\" (paragraph 3). It is important when reading this passage to keep clear the author's central distinction between novelists and poets and their responses to the age.\nThe passage contrasts the response of novelists and poets to the radical change that characterized the nineteenth century. To the extent that the passage author describes writers as addressing \"psychological\" questions, this emphasis is attributed to poets, not to the novelists that this question asks about. (The author writes in the final paragraph, for instance, that the \"modern popular stereotype of artists as iconoclastic, maladjusted, highly individualistic people\" stems from the Romantic poetry of the era.)\nThe author explains that in the wake of radical social and economic and intellectual changes (detailed in the first paragraph), the novel worked to \"comprehend and interpret\" these changes (paragraph 2). This option, claiming that the novel \"espous[ed]\" the \"new, more scientific ideas of the age,\" presents the novel as more directly didactic or propagandistic than is supported by the passage discussion of the novel.\nThe first paragraph in particular details the dramatic social and economic changes that characterized the era (industrialization and rationalization chief among them) and explains that the novel sought to negotiate the challenges of this new world, supporting this option. The author writes: \"In the novel, which during the nineteenth century assumed major importance as a literary form, a powerful effort was made to symbolize, to comprehend, and to interpret in terms of value the increasing complexities of modern society\" (paragraph 2).\nKhan Academy Lessons",

    "correct_answer": "A",

    "explanation": "Solution: The correct answer is A.\nThe prompt clearly supports the author's discussion about the inspirations of the romantic poets. The statement about Coleridge's reliance on images from ancient Chinese history supports the passage claim that the romantic poets often looked \"outward to remote and fascinating nations or centuries\" (paragraph 3) for inspiration. The reference to the poem coming in part from a dream supports the author's contention that the poets valued both \"individualism\" and the \"creative imagination\" (paragraph 3).\nThe author says that the \"modern popular stereotype of artists as iconoclastic, maladjusted, highly individualistic people in revolt against their era and misunderstood by family, friends, and the public alike dates from the romantic movement\" (final paragraph), though does not explicitly endorse that \"stereotype,\" saying only that it applies to some \"great poets.\" Regardless of the author's position on the stereotype, the statement in the question prompt about the source of the images in \"Kubla Khan\" does not support the claim or belief that the romantic poets were \"maladjusted and antisocial.\"\nThe author does not say that the romantic poets focused \"primarily\" on the natural landscapes of England. Instead, the author says that the poets reacted against \"most of the historical\" changes that took place in their period. This included a focus on \"natural landscape and rural countryside\" (paragraph 3), in reaction to the period's trend toward urbanization, but the claim in this option is not supported by the passage.\nThe passage author does not say that romantic poets were particularly, let alone \"primarily,\" focused on the revolutionary issues of their period.

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "your_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Solution: The correct answer is D.\nThere is no information indicating that any of the bacteria listed in Table 1 impact polypeptide digestion.\nDietary fibers are not absorbed by the human intestine.\nBased on Table 1, the two bacteria that produce propionate, Phascolactobacteria and Odoribacter, are decreased in CD-affected individuals. Thus, the levels of propionate are most likely decreased, rather than increased, in CD-affected individuals.\nAs explained in the passage, molecules such as butyrate, acetate, and propionate inhibit the inflammatory response against commensal bacteria of the GI tract. CD is an inflammatory condition, in which Table 1 indicates that many bacteria producing these anti-inflammatory molecules are reduced during CD. This is consistent with the interpretation that inflammation observed during CD is caused by decreased production of propionate, butyrate, and acetate, which decreases immune tolerance of commensal bacteria.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

    "passage": "Passage 3 (Questions 15-20)\nErythropoietin (EPO) is a glycoprotein hormone that stimulates the production of erythrocytes in red bone marrow. Although EPO is primarily produced and released by the kidneys in response to low tissue levels of oxygen, several other tissues, including the liver and neurons of the central nervous system (CNS), can produce EPO. EPO binds the EPO receptor (EPOR) in erythrocyte precursor cells, causing them to differentiate into mature erythrocytes that are released into circulation. As the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood increases, secretion of EPO by the kidneys decreases. Neurons in the CNS also express EPOR, and EPO has been shown to decrease apoptosis of both erythrocyte precursor cells and CNS neurons. EPO also promotes angiogenesis, the production of new blood vessels. The human EPO gene has been cloned and expressed in vitro. The recombinant gene product (rHuEPO) is frequently administered to patients who have anemia resulting from either kidney failure or chemotherapy.\nMore recently, it has been shown that a significant number of tumors express EPOR, even though the healthy tissue from which the tumor was derived does not. Experiments in mice indicate that EPO prevents apoptosis and increases angiogenesis in at least some types of EPOR-positive tumors.",

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "your_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Solution: The correct answer is D.\nEPO is a glycoprotein and, therefore, cannot cross the membrane. Consequently, EPOR would not likely be positioned within the cytosol.\nThe endoplasmic reticulum is a site for protein glycosylation, but not the likely site where EPOR localizes. Instead, since EPO is a glycoprotein, it cannot cross the membrane, and must bind to receptors on the cell surface.\nEPO is not able to cross the membrane to reach the nucleus, as it is a glycoprotein. Consequently, EPOR is not likely positioned within the nucleus.\nEPO, being a glycoprotein, cannot cross the cell membrane. Consequently, it is likely that EPOR is located on the surface of the plasma membrane.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

After colonizing the small intestine, V. cholerae secretes cholera toxin (CTX), a protein that ribosylates the Gsα subunit of a G protein, thereby inhibiting its GTPase activity. This causes the dysregulation of a cellular chloride ion channel, resulting in efflux of ions and water from the infected enterocytes into the intestinal lumen.\nStudies have implicated sodium bioenergetics in the pathogenesis of V. cholerae in humans. An electrochemical gradient of Na+ known as the “sodium motive force” provides V. cholerae with the energy for key functions. The gradient is predominantly established by the Na+-pumping NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (Na+-NQR) enzyme. Na+-NQR is a multi-substrate enzyme comprised of six distinct subunits designated A–F (Table 1) that are encoded within the same operon. In a process similar to proton pumping by Complex I of the electron transport chain, Na+-NQR couples the movement of electrons from an NADH donor with ion transport.\nTable 1    Biochemical Features of V. cholerae Na+-NQR Subunits\nProperty Number of amino acid residues Molecular weight (kDa) pI Number of transmembrane helices \nNqrA 426 47.6 6.30  0 \nNqrB 415 47.4 7.16 8 \nNqrC 257 28.6 7.30  2 \nNqrD 210 22.8 8.50  5 \nNqrE 198 20.5 5.35  6 \n NqrF  408 47.1   5.25 1 \nResearchers investigated the kinetic features of Na+-NQR.

    "passage": "Passage 5 (Questions 25-28)\nCholera is an acute, diarrheal disease caused by infection of the intestine with the gram-negative, motile bacterium Vibrio cholerae. After colonizing the small intestine, V. cholerae secretes cholera toxin (CTX), a protein that ribosylates the Gsα subunit of a G protein, thereby inhibiting its GTPase activity. This causes the dysregulation of a cellular chloride ion channel, resulting in efflux of ions and water from the infected enterocytes into the intestinal lumen.\nStudies have implicated sodium bioenergetics in the pathogenesis of V. cholerae in humans. An electrochemical gradient of Na+ known as the “sodium motive force” provides V. cholerae with the energy for key functions. The gradient is predominantly established by the Na+-pumping NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (Na+-NQR) enzyme. Na+-NQR is a multi-substrate enzyme comprised of six distinct subunits designated A–F (Table 1) that are encoded within the same operon. In a process similar to proton pumping by Complex I of the electron transport chain, Na+-NQR couples the movement of electrons from an NADH donor with ion transport.\nTable 1    Biochemical Features of V. cholerae Na+-NQR Subunits\nProperty Number of amino acid residues Molecular weight (kDa) pI Number of transmembrane helices \nNqrA 426 47.6 6.30  0 \nNqrB 415 47.4 7.16 8 \nNqrC 257 28.6 7.30  2 \nNqrD 210 22.8 8.50  5 \nNqrE 198 20.5 5.35  6 \n NqrF  408 47.1   5.25 1 \nResearchers investigated the kinetic features of Na+-NQR.

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "your_answer": "Unknown",
    "explanation": "Solution: The correct answer is B.\nA sodium ionophore does not interfere with the function of Na+-NQR, but it degrades the sodium gradient (sodium motive force) that is established by the action of Na+-NQR.\nIonophores are compounds that bind to ions and facilitate their movements across membranes. A sodium ionophore would collapse the sodium gradient (sodium motive force) that is established by the action of Na+-NQR, resulting in decreased production of ATP.\nV. cholerae uses an electrochemical gradient of Na+, not of protons, to generate ATP. Therefore the pH of the periplasm is not affected.\nSince sodium ionophores degrade the electrochemical gradient required for ATP synthesis, they cause a decrease in ATP levels. To compensate for this event, V. cholerae is likely to increase the flux of electrons to the respiratory chain, which results in increased, not decreased, oxygen consumption.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

    "explanation": "Solution: The correct answer is D.\nNot necessarily, as transmembrane proteins could remain embedded within the membrane leaflet that was removed.\nEven if the small bumps were identified as cholesterol, proteins could still be positioned within the membrane leaflet that was removed.\nBecause the middle of the bilayer is hydrophobic, the lipids do not need to be embedded in the proteins.\nThe Fluid Mosaic Model indicates that the hydrophilic regions of proteins are found on the membrane surfaces, while the hydrophobic regions are buried among phospholipid tails. This arrangement allows proteins to span the membrane. Consistently, the passage mentions that, upon peeling back the top membrane layer, small bumps are observed. This is consistent with the idea that proteins span the membrane. If these bumps were identified as cholesterol, this does not necessarily disprove the model. Instead, it is possible that membrane-spanning proteins remain adhered to the leaflet that has been peeled back.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

Therefore, not defining a cell size is not a weakness of the Unit Membrane Model.\nNutrients and wastes are often exchanged by crossing the cell membrane. The Fluid Mosaic Model describes transmembrane proteins that can mediate such exchange. However, the Unit Membrane Model does not provide a mechanism for how the passage of nutrients and wastes occurs.\nThe Unit Membrane Model does act as a barrier between the cell interior and the cell's external environment. This is because the hydrophobic environment of the membrane will not permit the transport of hydrophilic molecules.\nThe passage of polar molecules through the phospholipid bilayer is not described by the Unit Membrane Model.

    "passage": "Passage 8 (Questions 41-44)\nUpon exposure to pro-inflammatory agents such as TNFα, cells produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can react with guanine bases in DNA to generate 8-oxo-G. This modified guanine can participate in Hoogsteen base pairs with adenine, an event that upon DNA replication results in G to T and C to A mutations. Guanine-rich promoter regions are particularly susceptible to this type of ROS-induced DNA damage.\nOGG1 is a DNA glycosylase that recognizes 8-oxo-G. OGG1 is involved in two processes: base excision repair of 8-oxo-G as well as transcription initiation for pro-inflammatory genes such as Cxcl family members. These transcription events also involve binding of NF-κB to promoters as NF-κB recruitment increases dramatically following OGG1 binding to DNA.\nTH5487 is a compound that mimics 8-oxo-G structure and binds to the active site of OGG1. Using reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR), researchers examined whether increasing levels of TH5487 affected the expression of a pro-inflammatory gene following TNFα exposure (Figure 1). Next, the researchers exposed both wild-type and Ogg1-knockout (Ogg1–/–) mice to TNFα in the presence and absence of TH5487 and monitored Cxcl1 expression levels (Figure 2).\nFigure 1 Effect of TH5487 on pro-inflammatory gene expression levels following exposure to TNFα\nFigure 2 Cxcl1 expression levels for wild-type and Ogg1–/– mice in the presence (+) and absence (–) of TNFα and TH5487",

    "your_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Solution: The correct answer is C.\nBased on the passage, TH5487-bound OGG1 cannot bind DNA. The inability of OGG1 to bind DNA should lead to decreased recruitment and promoter occupancy for NF-κB in the presence of TH5487.\nBased on the passage, TH5487-bound OGG1 cannot bind DNA. The inability of OGG1 to bind DNA should lead to decreased, not enhanced, recruitment and promoter occupancy for NF-κB in the presence of TH5487.\nThe passage notes that cells increase ROS production in the presence of pro-inflammatory signals such as TNFα and that this leads to generation of 8-oxo-G. OGG1 binding of 8-oxo-G within the promoter drives NF-κB recruitment to the promoter. This means that NF-κB occupancy of the promoter should increase when the cell is exposed to TNFα.\nBased on the passage, OGG1 binding of 8-oxo-G within the promoter drives NF-κB recruitment to the promoter.

It accomplishes this task by binding to another protein, E2F, a transcription factor needed for further progression through the cell cycle. Normal progression through the cell cycle is accomplished when cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) phosphorylate RB, preventing its binding to E2F.\nMany viruses can induce abnormal exit from G1 using viral proteins that bind to RB at a motif at the N-terminal called LXCXE. An example is the E7 papilloma protein, which causes the excessive proliferation of cells in warts.\nThe site at which LXCXE proteins bind is called the pocket domain and is highly conserved on RB and related proteins in plants and animals. The configuration of the pocket domain is well established. Mutant experimental RB proteins are available with alterations in the conserved amino acids of the pocket domain.\nA simple explanation for the ability of E7 to inactivate RB would be that both E7 and E2F bind to the pocket domain.

Although more than one mechanism appears to be involved in generating this response, the antibody-mediated response is the best understood. Development of the antibody-mediated response occurs in two stages, the first being the generation of an abnormal immune response during initial exposure to milk proteins and the second being the generation of an inflammatory response upon subsequent exposure. Symptoms of antibody-mediated CMA may include hives and respiratory difficulty. Anaphylactic shock rarely occurs but can be fatal if not treated immediately.\nLactose intolerance, also known as lactase deficiency, is a condition that results from insufficient synthesis of the enzyme lactase, which converts lactose into glucose and galactose. Although all healthy newborns produce sufficient levels of lactase, two distinct phenotypes exist in adults: lactase persistence (LP) (includes heterozygotes) and lactase non-persistence (LNP). LP adults continue to produce lactase into adulthood, whereas LNP individuals do not. It has been suggested that the LP phenotype is the result of a mutation event that coincided with the domestication of dairy animals thousands of years ago in areas such as northwestern Europe and within some Afro-Arabian nomadic populations. In Northwestern Europeans, sets of alleles located closely together on the same chromosome (haplotypes) associated with the LP phenotype contain several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, only one appears to be directly responsible for this phenotype; the others are silent. By comparison, several different SNPs appear to be directly responsible for the LP phenotype in Afro-Arabian LP-associated haplotypes.",

    "answer_choices": "A. an intron within the lactase gene.\nB. the coding sequence of the lactase gene.\nC. an enhancer sequence of the lactase gene.\nD. the stop codon at the end of the lactase gene.",
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "your_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Solution: The correct answer is C.\nAlthough introns might have regulatory functions, mutations to promoter and enhancer regions most specifically alter gene expression.\nA mutation in the coding region is most likely associated with a mutated enzyme, which is not the case with the LP. Instead, lactase expression is altered during LP.\nThe enhancer is a DNA region that is able to bind transcriptional activators in order to increase the expression of a particular gene. Since LP is caused by continuous lactase synthesis, this is the region most likely targeted by the mutation. Specifically, the mutation makes it easier for transcriptional activators to bind an enhancer sequence.\nA mutation affecting the STOP codon would result in a mutated enzyme, which is not the case in LP.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

    "your_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Solution: The correct answer is C.\nThis question references the passage sentence that states \"Early experiences with caregivers become internalized into a working model of expectations about self...\" In cognitive psychology, insight typically refers to the novel realization of a solution to a problem. The model described in the passage is representative of a knowledge structure that sets expectations regarding the self and relationships, which is best described as a schema.\nA critical period refers to a stage, usually in early development, when the individual is more receptive to learning from specific types of experiences (for instance, linguistic interaction) compared to later points in development. The model referenced in the prompt does not refer to a developmental stage.\nSchemas are knowledge structures that determine one's expectations in different contexts, including social interactions. The model that is referenced in the prompt is best described as a schema.\nHeuristics are cognitive rules of thumb that offer shortcuts to reasoning and problem solving. The model described in the passage defines expectations regarding relationships, which is more consistent with the definition of a schema.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

    "passage": "Passage 2 (Questions 7-10)\nA patient who experiences low self-esteem seeks the help of a therapist. The therapist finds that the patient’s self-esteem problems started after his current relationship began. The patient describes his current partner as being highly successful and competent and reports feeling inferior to his partner. He reports that he “hates feeling that way.” He has stopped attending social events with his partner because such events elevate his feelings of inferiority. However, despite his feelings of inferiority and envy, the patient also reports having extreme admiration and love for his partner.\nWhen researching for the case, the therapist reads a study on interpersonal attraction. The researchers asked participants to rate their actual self and their ideal self on 50 personality dimensions. These ratings were then used to develop two scores as proxy measures of actual and ideal self. Then, the participants were told that they were going to be paired with potential dates and were given information on their potential dates’ scores on the same personality dimensions. The dates’ scores were made up by the researchers to be either similar to or different from each participant’s actual self or ideal scores. The study showed that participants reported greater interest in dates who were similar to their ideal selves than in dates who were similar to their actual selves. The therapist finds the study relevant to the patient’s case but is reluctant to make direct inferences because she suspects that the participants’ ratings of actual self may have been influenced by social desirability.\nThe therapist decides that the self-evaluation maintenance model (SEM) may help explain the patient’s case. The model posits that upward comparison (comparing oneself with a more successful other) can lead to negative self-evaluation, which causes psychological distress. The individual is motivated to eliminate this distress, either by downplaying the relevance of the dimension of comparison (for example, if the patient’s partner is a successful mathematician, the patient can state that mathematical skills are not that important) or by weakening the social bonds with the successful other.",

    "explanation": "Solution: The correct answer is C.\nAccording to psychodynamic theory, the superego is the structure of personality which houses an individual's conscience, developed via the internalization of parental and societal expectations and values. The superego demands that one perform to their highest possible standard, which makes this statement a plausible application of psychodynamic theory to explain psychological responses to upward comparison.\nAccording to psychodynamic theory, the ego is the structure of personality responsible for balancing the conflicting demands of the id and the superego. When these demands are not met, anxiety is experienced. This statement is a plausible application of psychodynamic theory to explain psychological responses to upward comparison.\nWhile the id does operate according to the pleasure principle, according to psychodynamic theory, it is the responsibility of the ego and not the id to resolve subconscious conflict caused by the superego. Thus, this statement is not a plausible application of psychodynamic theory to explain psychological responses to upward comparison.\nRationalization is a defense mechanism, and according to psychodynamic theory, defense mechanisms are used to reduce anxiety stemming from unconscious conflicts.

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "your_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Solution: The correct answer is D.\nCultural transmission refers to the transmission of values and practices from one generation to another. The prompt does not describe cultural transmission.\nCultural relativism indicates evaluating the cultural practices of a different society not from one’s own cultural perspective, but from that society’s perspective. The prompt does not contain information about the immigrant community or the larger society practicing cultural relativism.\nCultural diffusion indicates the mutual exchange of cultural values and practices among cultural groups in a society or among societies. The prompt does not describe the cultural values accepted by the society of the host country; therefore the cultural exchange is not mutual.\nAssimilation is a social dynamic where a culture becomes indistinguishable from the majority culture. This answer is correct because an immigrant group expressing the cultural values of a new country indicates the adoption of the values of the host country.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "your_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Solution: The correct answer is D.\nThe elaboration likelihood model focuses on the role of central and peripheral characteristics of a communication in changing individuals' attitudes. High elaboration processing is likely to involve processing through the central characteristics of a message, which refer to its informational content and the quality of its arguments. These are not the cues presented by the administrator that shape participants' attitudes toward them.\nCentral route processing occurs when the central characteristics of a message, such as its informational content and the quality of its arguments, are used to form an attitude. The attitude formation in the passage is based on the behavioral cues presented by the administrator, which are peripheral characteristics.\nCareful processing of information is more likely to attune participants to the central characteristics in a communication. The attitude formation in the passage is most likely determined by the peripheral characteristics.\nPeripheral characteristics of a communication refer to the message characteristics that are not central to the information and arguments presented in the message, such as the emotional appeals made to the audience or characteristics of the individual presenting the message.

As more sugar is added, subtle changes in the sweetness of wine can be detected by both experts and novices. However, the lowest level of an odor that can be detected does not seem to be improved with training.\nOne of the most basic distinctions in beverage flavor profiles is the difference between wines derived from red and white grapes. In one study, researchers found that experts used different vocabularies of words when describing red and white wines. Experts, they found, tended to use words that suggested dark or red objects (such as “cherry”) for red wines and light or yellow objects (such as “honey”) for white wines.\nTo examine whether visual information was more relevant than a flavor profile in eliciting an accurate description of the wine’s flavor, researchers had 54 novices—students training to become sommeliers—perform two different wine comparison sessions. In each individual testing session, people tasted two different wines, one red and one white, and described the two wines. In the second session, one week after the first, both of the wines were actually the same; the white wine had been colored red and substituted for the red wine. The results are shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1 Mean number of terms by condition\n\n\nAdapted from G. Morrot, F. Brochet, and D. Dubourdieu, “The Color of Odors.” Brain and Language. ©2001 Elsevier.",

    "answer_choices": "A. increase the antagonistic effects of acetylcholine.\nB. increase the duration of acetylcholine action.\nC. inhibit the release of acetylcholine.\nD. inhibit the formation of acetylcholine.",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "your_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Solution: The correct answer is B.\nAntagonistic effects are those that oppose the function of a particular molecule, whereas agonistic effects are those that are consistent with the action of a molecule. Within the synapse, acetylcholine functions to activate acetylcholine receptors. Activity of acetylcholine is opposed by acetylcholinesterase, which breaks down acetycholine in the synaptic cleft. As donepezil is an AchEI, it increases the length of time acetylcholine is present in the synaptic cleft, activating acetylcholine receptors. Increased acetylcholine activity within the synaptic cleft will therefore be associated with increased agonistic, not antagonistic, effects.\nDonepezil is an AchEI, in which acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine. Within the synaptic cleft, acetylcholine activates post-synaptic acetylcholine receptors. In breaking down acetylcholine, acetylcholinesterase decreases activity of acetylcholine within the synapse. Consequently, by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, donepezil will slow acetylcholine degradation. This will maintain acetylcholine activity within the synaptic cleft for a longer duration.\nDonepezil is identified as an AchEI. Acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme within the synaptic cleft that degrades acetylcholine after it has been released from a pre-synaptic neuron. Despite this, activity of acetylcholinesterase does not directly impact release of acetylcholine from the pre-synaptic neuron. Consequently, inhibition of acetylcholinesterase using donepezil will not directly impact acetylcholine release.\nDonepezil is an AchEI. Acetylcholinesterase functions to degrade acetycholine that has been released into the synaptic cleft. Consequently, donepezil treatment functions to inhibit acetylcholine break down. Acetylcholinesterase is not directly involved in the formation of acetylcholine, which is mediated by a separate enzyme. Therefore, donepezil treatment will not directly inhibit acetylcholine formation.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

    "passage": "Passage 6 (Questions 31-35)\nUsing both structural and ecological perspectives, researchers examined childbearing among African American adolescents in metropolitan areas of the U.S.\nThe structural perspective focuses on how living in low socioeconomic status (SES) neighborhoods can affect the risk of adolescent childbearing. This perspective is divided into two explanations. Structural explanation 1 posits that the shift of industrial production away from urban centers led to an outmigration of middle-class African American families and a subsequent concentration of poverty in some African American neighborhoods. Structural explanation 2 posits that residential segregation in urban areas concentrates poverty and contributes to neighborhood decline.\nThe ecological perspective suggests that a neighborhood’s impact on childbearing is mediated by characteristics and changes in families. The ecological perspective includes a potentiator model, which refers to correspondence between risks from the environment and those from the family, as well as a protective model, which describes how more affluent families tend to protect their adolescents from risks in the environment.\nData were obtained from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and were based on a sample of 940 African American females born between 1953 and 1968.

Suburbanization is the out-migration from cities to suburbs, which often involves middle-class residents leaving behind low-income residents. Therefore, suburbanization is best explained with the out-migration of middle-class African American households.\nThis option focuses on residential segregation which is the consequence of suburbanization; therefore, it does not explain suburbanization.\nThe potentiator model does not explain suburbanization since this model focuses on the risks emerging from someone's social environment.\nThe protective model does not describe suburbanization because it is about the household resources to protect a child from the risks in their social environment.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

The question describes the intersection of racial and class backgrounds; therefore, intersectionality would apply to the study.\nSocial role conflict indicates the conflicting demands of two different social roles an individual carries.

In Study 1, researchers examined the conditions under which individuals are willing to update their beliefs about the frequency of various negative life events, such as Alzheimer’s disease or robbery. In the first phase of the experiment, the participants were asked about their preconceived notions of the frequency of negative events. The researchers found a tendency to underestimate the frequency of negative events. The participants also believed that they were at a lower risk of experiencing negative events compared to other individuals. In the second phase of the experiment, the participants were given new information about the frequency of various negative events. Sometimes the new information was better than what the participant expected (for example, they were told that negative events occur less frequently than they had thought).

For Group B, the written summary contained small errors that made the car accident appear less serious than it really was. For the control group, the written summary contained no errors. After a delay of one more week, the participants were asked to retrieve their memory of the original video as accurately as they could. The researchers were interested in the participants’ likelihood of creating false memories for the car accident.\nAdapted from T. Sharot, C. W. Korn, and R. J.

    "passage": "Passage 9 (Questions 48-51)\nResearch has implicated stress as a contributing factor to cognitive decline in aging. Stress-related hormones have been found to affect the hippocampus. Studies on animals have shown that chronic increases in stress-related hormones are associated with reduced dendritic spines, decreased long-term potentiation, and reduced neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Studies on humans show that people who have experienced posttraumatic stress disorder have reduced hippocampal volume. In contrast to stress, exercise has been shown to benefit learning and memory functioning in aged animals.\nA study was designed to investigate the relative effects of exercise and lifetime stress on hippocampal volume and cognitive functioning in humans. Participants were selected from older adults. To assess lifetime stress, participants were given a list of stressors and were asked to indicate the number of times they experienced each. To assess exercise engagement, they completed a questionnaire regarding their cardiovascular activity for the past ten years. To assess cognitive functioning, they were presented with a list of fifteen items categorizable as animals, clothing, and furniture. After participating in a 2-minute distraction task, they were asked to recall as many of the items as possible and categorize them. The volume of the hippocampus was also assessed for each participant.\nBased on the exercise assessment, participants were grouped into “high exercise” or “low exercise” categories. The results of the study showed that lifetime stress was negatively correlated with hippocampal volume and memory for low exercise participants, but no correlation was found between these variables for the high exercise participants.\n\n  Adapted from D.

    "your_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Solution: The correct answer is B.\nThe passage indicates that increased levels of stress-related hormones are associated with reduced hippocampal neurogenesis, and subsequent reduced hippocampal volume, in animal models. However, melatonin is a hormone that is most associated with regulation of the sleep-wake cycle.\nThe animal studies described indicate that increased levels of stress-related hormones are associated with reduced neurogenesis in the hippocampus, and subsequent reduced hippocampal volume. Cortisol is a hormone that is  specifically released during stressful situations and is a primary mediator of physiological changes associated with stress. Consequently, increased cortisol levels are most likely responsible for reduced hippocampal volume observed with stress.\nAccording to the passage, animal studies have demonstrated that increased levels of stress-related hormones lead to decreased hippocampal neurogenesis and decreased hippocampal volume. Prolactin, however, primarily functions in the production of milk for lactation.\nThe animal models described indicate that increased levels of stress-related hormones lead to decreased hippocampal neurogenesis and decreased hippocampal volume. Oxytocin, however, functions to stimulate uterine contractions and milk ejection. While oxytocin can also impact mood, this occurs by alleviating, not promoting, the effects of stress.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

    "passage": "Passage 9 (Questions 48-51)\nResearch has implicated stress as a contributing factor to cognitive decline in aging. Stress-related hormones have been found to affect the hippocampus. Studies on animals have shown that chronic increases in stress-related hormones are associated with reduced dendritic spines, decreased long-term potentiation, and reduced neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Studies on humans show that people who have experienced posttraumatic stress disorder have reduced hippocampal volume. In contrast to stress, exercise has been shown to benefit learning and memory functioning in aged animals.\nA study was designed to investigate the relative effects of exercise and lifetime stress on hippocampal volume and cognitive functioning in humans. Participants were selected from older adults. To assess lifetime stress, participants were given a list of stressors and were asked to indicate the number of times they experienced each. To assess exercise engagement, they completed a questionnaire regarding their cardiovascular activity for the past ten years. To assess cognitive functioning, they were presented with a list of fifteen items categorizable as animals, clothing, and furniture. After participating in a 2-minute distraction task, they were asked to recall as many of the items as possible and categorize them. The volume of the hippocampus was also assessed for each participant.\nBased on the exercise assessment, participants were grouped into “high exercise” or “low exercise” categories. The results of the study showed that lifetime stress was negatively correlated with hippocampal volume and memory for low exercise participants, but no correlation was found between these variables for the high exercise participants.\n\n  Adapted from D.

This is not the type of memory involved in recalling previously learned information.\nInformation is only maintained in short-term memory for approximately 20 seconds, unless it is actively rehearsed. Given the study included a 2-minute distraction task, the information being recalled would not be in short-term memory.\nEpisodic memory is long-term memory for personally experienced events. This is not the memory system used to recall and categorize a list of items.\nSemantic memory is memory for facts and knowledge. This is the memory system used for a categorization task which requires participants to use pre-existing knowledge to sort the items.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

The three major categories of recreational drugs are depressants, stimulants, and hallucinogens. Although these categories encompass a diverse group of chemicals with different structures, most of them increase the activity of dopamine circuits in the brain’s mesolimbic system.\nThe factors that motivate recreational drug use change as an individual gains experience with a particular drug. With continued use of alcohol and some other drugs, the user requires larger and larger doses to experience the same effect. At this point, an individual continues to use the substance in order to maintain a basic level of functionality. For instance, a chronic cigarette smoker might immediately light a cigarette upon awakening to clear a foggy head and eliminate irritability.\nChronic users are also increasingly likely to experience toxicity and medical complications. Ever increasing doses of most psychoactive drugs may lead to a condition in which the person craves and uses the substance despite its adverse consequences. Given the adverse consequences of chronic drug use, research has focused on determining the factors responsible for the onset of the behavior.\nNovice users are typically adolescents or young adults who view drug use as a means of gaining social acceptance from a peer group. The novelty of the sensory, motor, or emotional experiences produced by the drug high is another important factor for new users. Certain personality traits, such as impulse control and sensation seeking, have been found to be associated with drug use in adolescents.\nIn a study designed to determine whether specific traits could predict drug use, high school seniors completed a questionnaire regarding their past use of tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs. To assess personality, the researchers developed a brief inventory (the HP5) based on the Five-Factor Model of personality. Participants responded to 20 self-statements on a four-point response scale, where higher scores indicate that the individual has the trait being assessed.

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "your_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Solution: The correct answer is C.\n Stereotype threat indicates that an individual might be worried about conforming to a negatively stereotyped role due to their social background. The question does not describe stereotype threat.\n Social segregation refers to the isolation of a community from other communities based on its social background, such as gender, race/ethnicity, and class. Segregation is not discussed in the question.\nStigma refers to negative stereotypes associated with a group in the society. Stigmas bestow disadvantages to those labeled with the stereotypes and are often associated with health, ability, personal background, and social background. Shame directed towards HIV/AIDS patients indicate a negative stereotype that would have negative outcomes for the patients, and the public health intervention campaigns most likely seek to address those stigmas.\nDiscrimination is the unfair treatment of an individual or a community due to their social background. Although discrimination might be a consequence of stigmatization of a social group, the question only describes the negative attitudes, but not discriminatory behavior.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

    "question_text": "A postsynaptic cell has a resting membrane potential of -65mV with a threshold potential of -55mV. Will an action potential be generated by a single stimulus that lowers the membrane potential of the postsynaptic cell by 15mV?",
    "answer_choices": "A. Yes, because the stimulus caused the membrane potential to exceed the threshold potential\nB. No, because the stimulus hyperpolarized the membrane, producing an inhibitory effect\nC. Yes, because the stimulus had an excitatory effect on the postsynaptic membrane\nD. No, because the depolarizing effect of the stimulus did not exceed the threshold potential",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "your_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Solution: The correct answer is B.\nThe postsynaptic cell has a threshold potential of –55 mV, such that an action potential will be generated if the cell reaches a membrane potential equal to or greater than –55 mV. However, the described stimulus will lower the membrane potential from –65 mV to –80 mV, which is below, not above, the threshold potential. Consequently, the postsynaptic cell will not generate an action potential.\nIn order for a postsynaptic cell to produce an action potential, its membrane potential must reach a threshold potential. In the described cell, this requires a shift in membrane potential from –65 mV (its resting membrane potential) to –55 mV (its threshold potential). This will be achieved by a depolarizing stimulus, which increases membrane potential. However, the described stimulus will hyperpolarize the membrane by shifting the membrane potential from –65 mV to –80 mV. The resulting hyperpolarization is associated with inhibition of the postsynaptic cell and an inability of the cell to generate an action potential.\nAn excitatory stimulus is one that increases the likelihood of a postsynaptic cell generating an action potential. In the described cell, an action potential will be generated if the membrane potential is increased from –65 mV to –55 mV. Therefore, a stimulus that lowers membrane potential will be inhibitory, not excitatory. This will be associated with a failure of the postsynaptic cell to fire an action potential.\nIn order for a postsynaptic cell to generate an action potential, a stimulus must be applied that raises the membrane potential of the cell to threshold. Increasing the membrane potential of a cell is referred to as depolarization, whereas decreasing the membrane potential of a cell is referred to as hyperpolarization. The described cell has a threshold value of –55 mV; however, the described stimulus will lower the membrane potential from –65 mV to –80 mV. While it is true that the described stimulus will fail to produce an action potential, as the postsynaptic cell will not reach threshold, this is because the described stimulus is hyperpolarizing, not depolarizing.\nKhan Academy Lessons",
