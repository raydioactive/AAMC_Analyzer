    "explanation": "The solution is B.\nBecause ΔG = ΔH – TΔS > 0, the reaction does not occur. If 0 < ΔH < TΔS, then ΔH – TΔS < 0, the reaction would occur. The entropy term would be larger than the enthalpy term and favor the reaction.\nThe reaction does not occur (is not spontaneous). This indicates that ΔG = ΔH – TΔS > 0. From inspection of the reaction, it can be concluded that ΔS > 0 (a gas evolves). Consequently, ΔH > TΔS explains why the reaction does not occur.\nSpontaneous reactions have ΔG = ΔH – TΔS < 0. From inspection of the reaction, it can be concluded that ΔS > 0 (a gas evolves). If ΔH < 0, then both the enthalpic and entropic terms would contribute to ΔG < 0. If ΔH is negative, then ΔG would also have to be negative, and the reaction would occur spontaneously.\nSpontaneous reactions have ΔG = ΔH – TΔS < 0.

    "your_answer": "Unknown",
    "explanation": "The solution is D.\nBoth 1-chlorobutane and 1-butanol are polar molecules with dipole moments that are greater than 1.5 D.\nBoth 1-chlorobutane and 1-butanol are polar, not nonpolar, molecules.\nThe boiling point of 1-chlorobutane is 78°C. The boiling point of 1-butanol is 118°C.\nThe fact that 1-chlorobutane will have a boiling point that is substantially lower than that of 1-butanol can be rationalized from chemical principles. The molecules have similar molecular weights, but 1-butanol has a hydroxyl functional group that can participate in hydrogen bonding. Hydrogen bonding is a particularly strong force of intermolecular attraction.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "your_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The solution is A.\nFirst, NaBH4 reduces the ketone to a secondary alcohol, the gamma-hydroxyester intermediate. Secondly, the alcohol group in this intermediate then reacts as a nucleophile with the carbonyl in the ethyl ester in the same molecule, forming a new ester by displacing C2H5OH as a leaving group. This cyclic ester is called a lactone, and the intramolecular transesterification yielding this lactone is called lactonization.\nNaBH4 is a reducing agent, not a hydrolyzing agent. Also, there is no acetal formed. Because an acetal has the structure R1O–CR2R3–OR4, where R1 and R4 = carbon groups and R2 and R3 = H and/or a carbon group, it may resemble a lactone (a cyclic ester), which also has two oxygen atoms attached to one carbon atom.\nAlthough NaBH4 is a reducing agent, it reduces aldehydes and ketones, not esters.

The active site of G3PP contains Asp14 and Asp16, which act as a nucleophile and general acid, respectively, during catalysis. In addition, catalysis requires the presence of a divalent cation in the active site.\nResearchers developed an assay to study the effect of pH on the activity of G3PP. UV–VIS spectroscopy was used to measure the concentration p-nitrophenol produced from a p-nitrophenol phosphate substrate. To aid in additional analysis, the substrate was isotopically labeled with 18O and 32P. The concentration was related to the absorbance through Beer’s Law, which relates the absorbance A to the molar absorptivity ε in units of M–1cm–1, path length of the sample cell in units of cm b, and the concentration of the solution c in units of M, by the relationship A = εbc. The path length of the cell used for all experiments was 1 cm. Because the molar absorptivity was affected by pH, it was necessary to determine this value at every pH tested.

Although the error rate for these enzymes is low, incorrect nucleotides are occasionally inserted during replication. The active site of a DNA polymerase is shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1 The active site of a DNA polymerase (Note: M2+ represents a divalent metal ion.)\nOne possible mechanism for incorporation of incorrect nucleotides is the formation of a mismatch between a nucleobase in the template strand and the nucleobase of an incoming dNTP.

Among many mispairing possibilities, either tautomerization or ionization of nucleobases (Figure 2) would allow a DNA polymerase to insert a mismatch with correct Watson–Crick geometry. For instance, given the DNA polymerase substrate shown in Figure 3, dGTP could be added instead of dATP. G•T mismatches occur in two different ways.

Electrodes, sometimes called “paddles,” are placed on a patient’s chest, and current can be passed from one electrode to the other once a switch is flipped by a medical professional. The defibrillator must be constructed to allow multiple uses with a minimal time delay (less than a minute) between applications. Suppose a capacitor in a portable defibrillator needs to store 400 J at 5000 V. Suppose further that half that energy is actually passed through a patient’s chest in a time of 1.0 ms.",

    "passage": "Passage 10 (Questions 53-56)\nWhen a person experiences cardiac arrest, that person’s heart undergoes what is called ventricular fibrillation. In such an event, various parts of the heart do not beat in a coordinated way, and the heart becomes unable to pump blood. Medical professionals often treat a cardiac arrest patient by administering an electric shock across the chest during which a current is passed through the heart in a relatively short amount of time (a few milliseconds). Such a shock can cause the heart to become temporarily paralyzed. The goal is that the paralyzed heart will then start beating in a normal way. Occasionally, medical professionals must administer an electric shock to a patient more than once.\nThe device medical professionals use to administer electric shocks to a patient is called a defibrillator. Portable defibrillators are found in ambulances and are used by emergency medical personnel on patients who could not get to the hospital. A portable defibrillator works by storing electric energy in a capacitor. Electrodes, sometimes called “paddles,” are placed on a patient’s chest, and current can be passed from one electrode to the other once a switch is flipped by a medical professional.

    "answer_choices": "A. All of the electrons in the conductor are bound to atoms, and thus there is no way for an external electric field to penetrate atoms with no net charge.\nB. Free electrons in the conductor arrange themselves on the surface so that the electric field they produce inside the conductor exactly cancels any external electric field.\nC. Free electrons in the conductor arrange themselves on the surface and throughout the interior so that the electric field they produce inside the conductor exactly cancels any external electric field.\nD.

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "your_answer": "Unknown",
    "explanation": "The solution is B.\nConductors are characterized by the existence of free electrons that carry current.\nConductors contain both atom-bound electrons and free electrons. Free electrons arrange themselves on the surface of conductors, and their collective electric field produced inside the conductor cancels any external electric field. The resulting electric field inside the conductor is zero.\nFree electrons arrange themselves only on the surface of the conductor. If they also arranged inside, the electric field inside the conductor would move the electrons even in the absence of a battery.\nBound electrons cannot arrange themselves on the surface of the conductor due to the binding effects.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

    "passage": "Passage 1 (Questions 1-6)\nThe origin of the impressive and enigmatic mounds of raised earth found in the Ohio and Mississippi river valleys has been the source of much conjecture. The long-popular idea that the mounds were the work of a vanished culture was convincingly refuted by the end of the nineteenth century by naturalist Cyrus Thomas, who proved not only that the mounds had been raised by early Native Americans, but also that mound building had continued in some areas up to the time of the arrival of the Europeans.\nArchaeologists remained reluctant, however, to postulate a strictly Native American origin for mound building. Instead, diffusion of the practice from some area where it was already well established seemed to be the best way to explain its apparently sudden and relatively late appearance in the eastern Woodlands of the United States. A few archaeologists suggested that mound building had diffused, along with cord-marked pottery found in the Woodlands, across the Bering Strait from Asia, but they had to admit that the absence of both traits in the intervening regions was problematic. According to another theory, mound building had been brought across the Atlantic from Scandinavia.\nBut the most widely accepted diffusionist theory attributed the mounds to influences from further south, from the area that is now Mexico, exerted either by transmission of ideas or by an actual immigration of colonists. The great size of some mounds implied the existence of a large labor force with enough leisure time to devote to construction projects. The work of specialist craftspeople, freed from subsistence tasks, seemed to be manifest in the fine quality of artifacts found in the mounds. Leisure time and craft specialization were inconceivable except as by-products of agriculture, and so archaeologists assumed that the mound builders were farmers who grew maize, beans, and squash. These staple crops were, of course, of Mexican origin. One could construct a neat diffusionary model, based on this evidence: Mexican emigrants brought their staple crops, pottery making, and mound building into the Woodlands, and imposed themselves upon the local inhabitants as a privileged elite.\nThe credibility of the Mexican hypothesis was weakened, however, as archaeologists realized that the Ohio mounds were older than those found in the Mississippi Valley; one would have expected the age of sites to decrease, rather than increase, as one moved north and east, away from the supposed Mexican homeland. Furthermore, archaeological expeditions to the northeastern corner of Mexico failed to produce evidence of any ancestral mound-building culture. In addition, as village sites in Ohio were excavated, it became clear that the early mound builders had grown little, if any, maize.\nThe faltering case for a Mexican connection received a much-needed boost when radiocarbon tests dated the mounds of Louisiana’s Poverty Point culture as early as 1200 BC, making them seven hundred years older than those in Ohio. The southerly location of Poverty Point, near the mouth of the Mississippi and not far from the Gulf coast, made it a plausible first stop for hypothetical Mexican culture bearers. However, pottery that was found at Poverty Point did not derive from Mexico, and maize was conspicuously absent. While squash might have been grown there, its presence at Poverty Point does not indicate a close relationship to Mexico because squash had diffused throughout the southeastern Woodlands regions as early as 2000 BC.\n    Adapted from S.

If, however, cord-marked Woodland pottery were found precisely in the intervening regions (between the Bering Strait and the Eastern Woodlands), this would presumably remedy that “problematic” lack of evidence and offer support for the theory that the mound-building had also diffused from Asia.\nThe author mentions “another theory” that the mounds might have “been brought across the Atlantic from Scandinavia” (paragraph 2), but the presence of the pottery in the areas referred to in the question stem is not discussed in relation to that claim.\nThe presence of the pottery between the Bering Strait and the Eastern Woodlands is discussed as evidence that the mound-building might have diffused from Asia, not from the southern route of Mexico.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

    "passage": "Passage 1 (Questions 1-6)\nThe origin of the impressive and enigmatic mounds of raised earth found in the Ohio and Mississippi river valleys has been the source of much conjecture. The long-popular idea that the mounds were the work of a vanished culture was convincingly refuted by the end of the nineteenth century by naturalist Cyrus Thomas, who proved not only that the mounds had been raised by early Native Americans, but also that mound building had continued in some areas up to the time of the arrival of the Europeans.\nArchaeologists remained reluctant, however, to postulate a strictly Native American origin for mound building. Instead, diffusion of the practice from some area where it was already well established seemed to be the best way to explain its apparently sudden and relatively late appearance in the eastern Woodlands of the United States. A few archaeologists suggested that mound building had diffused, along with cord-marked pottery found in the Woodlands, across the Bering Strait from Asia, but they had to admit that the absence of both traits in the intervening regions was problematic. According to another theory, mound building had been brought across the Atlantic from Scandinavia.\nBut the most widely accepted diffusionist theory attributed the mounds to influences from further south, from the area that is now Mexico, exerted either by transmission of ideas or by an actual immigration of colonists. The great size of some mounds implied the existence of a large labor force with enough leisure time to devote to construction projects. The work of specialist craftspeople, freed from subsistence tasks, seemed to be manifest in the fine quality of artifacts found in the mounds. Leisure time and craft specialization were inconceivable except as by-products of agriculture, and so archaeologists assumed that the mound builders were farmers who grew maize, beans, and squash. These staple crops were, of course, of Mexican origin. One could construct a neat diffusionary model, based on this evidence: Mexican emigrants brought their staple crops, pottery making, and mound building into the Woodlands, and imposed themselves upon the local inhabitants as a privileged elite.\nThe credibility of the Mexican hypothesis was weakened, however, as archaeologists realized that the Ohio mounds were older than those found in the Mississippi Valley; one would have expected the age of sites to decrease, rather than increase, as one moved north and east, away from the supposed Mexican homeland. Furthermore, archaeological expeditions to the northeastern corner of Mexico failed to produce evidence of any ancestral mound-building culture. In addition, as village sites in Ohio were excavated, it became clear that the early mound builders had grown little, if any, maize.\nThe faltering case for a Mexican connection received a much-needed boost when radiocarbon tests dated the mounds of Louisiana’s Poverty Point culture as early as 1200 BC, making them seven hundred years older than those in Ohio. The southerly location of Poverty Point, near the mouth of the Mississippi and not far from the Gulf coast, made it a plausible first stop for hypothetical Mexican culture bearers. However, pottery that was found at Poverty Point did not derive from Mexico, and maize was conspicuously absent. While squash might have been grown there, its presence at Poverty Point does not indicate a close relationship to Mexico because squash had diffused throughout the southeastern Woodlands regions as early as 2000 BC.\n    Adapted from S. J. Fiedel, Prehistory of the Americas. ©1987 Cambridge University Press.",

Pottery from ancient Mexico is stylistically similar to Native American pottery found in the Woodlands.\nC. There is evidence that emigration took place about 1200 BC from the area that is now Mexico to western areas of the U.S.\nD. Leisure time tends to decrease when a people switches to farming from hunting and gathering.",
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "your_answer": "Unknown",
    "explanation": "The solution is D.\nThe absence of this correlation would merely challenge the assumption that the presence of such artifacts implies leisure time (the passage indicates that specialized craftspeople were “freed from subsistence tasks” (paragraph 3). That the presence of large mounds implies leisure time, and therefore agriculture—a crucial building block in the “Mexican hypothesis”—would still stand.\nStylistic similarities between Mexican pottery and Native American pottery does not affect the Mexican hypothesis in one way or another. While such similarities might be interpreted as support for a Mexican influence on Native American culture (and thus could support the Mexican hypothesis), it is also possible that Native American pottery styles could have influenced Mexican styles.\nThere is no discussion in the passage of mound-building in the western areas of the U.S., so such evidence is irrelevant. One might speculate that people who emigrated to western areas of the U.S. might then have moved to the eastern areas, but that would support—rather than weaken—the Mexican hypothesis.\nThe Mexican hypothesis rests on a series of assumptions about the conditions that would have enabled the construction of the large mounds found in the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys. The author writes that “The great size of some mounds implied the existence of a large labor force with enough leisure time to devote to construction projects. The work of specialist craftspeople, freed from subsistence tasks, seemed to be manifest in the fine quality of the artifacts found in the mounds. Leisure time and craft specialization were inconceivable except as by-products of agriculture, and so archaeologists assumed that the mound builders were farmers who grew maize, beans, and squash. These staple crops were, of course, of Mexican origin” (paragraph 3). If, however, leisure time decreases with the advent of agriculture, then it would no longer follow that Mexican farmers were likely to have had the time to devote to the building of the mounds, which would of course weaken the hypothesis.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

    "passage": "Passage 2 (Questions 7-12)\nMany rural Americans have limited access to health care. This problem stems from two aspects of the U.S. healthcare system: the many Americans without health insurance and the tendency of healthcare professionals to locate and practice in relatively affluent urban and suburban areas.\nThe medical education system could help to increase access to rural health care by selecting, training, and deploying more healthcare workers who choose to practice in rural areas. R. C. Talley writes in Academic Medicine that students with rural origins are more likely to train in primary care and return to rural areas; residents trained in rural areas are more likely to choose to practice in rural areas; family medicine is the key discipline of rural health care; and residents practice close to where they train. This approach takes advantage of free-market solutions. Rather than relying on federal or state delivery systems that may be controversial, complex, and expensive, graduating residents gravitate to underserved areas as a result of their own desires. Although this kind of intervention does not lend itself to controlled experiments, ample evidence exists that such an approach works. At publicly owned medical schools in rural states, particularly those that see their mission as training future family physicians, high proportions of the graduates ultimately practice in rural areas. By contrast, research-intensive private schools in metropolitan areas with no commitment to family medicine have virtually no graduates working in rural areas.\nTargeted incentives can also work to improve the flow of health professionals to rural areas. This approach relies on the assumption that physicians and others act as rational economic beings. If the economic reward for providing services to rural areas is increased, the logic goes, physicians should be more likely to locate in these areas. This approach has been used with some success in Britain, Canada, and Australia, where a variety of bonuses increase reimbursement for selected rural practitioners.\nWhen educational interventions and economic incentives do not improve the geographic distribution of healthcare services, the major recourse is the creation of programs that provide direct services to underserved areas. There are numerous examples of such programs, the largest of which are the community health centers and the National Health Service Corps (NHSC). These two federal programs remain the preeminent safety net programs for rural America.\nFinally, the emerging technology of telemedicine (the remote delivery of health services and/or clinical information) has enormous potential for improving the healthcare access of rural populations. Currently, telemedicine is dynamic, but relatively unstructured, with a wide variety of public and private sector experiments proceeding simultaneously. Some applications, such as reading electrocardiograms at a distance, have become very common, while others, such as dermatology consultations, are being performed in many different areas but without standard protocols for transmission, interaction, evaluation, or payment.\nIn order for telemedicine to be most useful in helping underserved rural populations to access health care, three key areas must be addressed: amending professional licensure regulations to allow physicians in metropolitan areas to make their expertise available to remote rural areas, even across state lines; creating a unified technological infrastructure to allow rural providers to communicate with multiple providers of these distant services at a reasonable cost and without being captives of any single information provider; and mandating reasonable reimbursement by third-party payers for providing medical services at a distance.\n    Adapted from R.

    "passage": "Passage 2 (Questions 7-12)\nMany rural Americans have limited access to health care. This problem stems from two aspects of the U.S. healthcare system: the many Americans without health insurance and the tendency of healthcare professionals to locate and practice in relatively affluent urban and suburban areas.\nThe medical education system could help to increase access to rural health care by selecting, training, and deploying more healthcare workers who choose to practice in rural areas. R. C. Talley writes in Academic Medicine that students with rural origins are more likely to train in primary care and return to rural areas; residents trained in rural areas are more likely to choose to practice in rural areas; family medicine is the key discipline of rural health care; and residents practice close to where they train. This approach takes advantage of free-market solutions. Rather than relying on federal or state delivery systems that may be controversial, complex, and expensive, graduating residents gravitate to underserved areas as a result of their own desires. Although this kind of intervention does not lend itself to controlled experiments, ample evidence exists that such an approach works. At publicly owned medical schools in rural states, particularly those that see their mission as training future family physicians, high proportions of the graduates ultimately practice in rural areas. By contrast, research-intensive private schools in metropolitan areas with no commitment to family medicine have virtually no graduates working in rural areas.\nTargeted incentives can also work to improve the flow of health professionals to rural areas. This approach relies on the assumption that physicians and others act as rational economic beings. If the economic reward for providing services to rural areas is increased, the logic goes, physicians should be more likely to locate in these areas. This approach has been used with some success in Britain, Canada, and Australia, where a variety of bonuses increase reimbursement for selected rural practitioners.\nWhen educational interventions and economic incentives do not improve the geographic distribution of healthcare services, the major recourse is the creation of programs that provide direct services to underserved areas. There are numerous examples of such programs, the largest of which are the community health centers and the National Health Service Corps (NHSC). These two federal programs remain the preeminent safety net programs for rural America.\nFinally, the emerging technology of telemedicine (the remote delivery of health services and/or clinical information) has enormous potential for improving the healthcare access of rural populations. Currently, telemedicine is dynamic, but relatively unstructured, with a wide variety of public and private sector experiments proceeding simultaneously. Some applications, such as reading electrocardiograms at a distance, have become very common, while others, such as dermatology consultations, are being performed in many different areas but without standard protocols for transmission, interaction, evaluation, or payment.\nIn order for telemedicine to be most useful in helping underserved rural populations to access health care, three key areas must be addressed: amending professional licensure regulations to allow physicians in metropolitan areas to make their expertise available to remote rural areas, even across state lines; creating a unified technological infrastructure to allow rural providers to communicate with multiple providers of these distant services at a reasonable cost and without being captives of any single information provider; and mandating reasonable reimbursement by third-party payers for providing medical services at a distance.\n    Adapted from R.

    "passage": "Passage 3 (Questions 13-17)\nSince 1856, when a thick-browed, human-like skull turned up in Germany’s Neander valley, the ancient people known as Neandertals have suffered a less-than-flattering reputation. Their greater muscle mass and simple tools contributed to their image as the brutish cousins of the human family. Although Neandertals’ brains were roughly the same size as those of modern people, they often have been portrayed as lacking the language skills, foresight, creativity, and other cognitive abilities of modern humans. In this view, the simpler ways of Neandertals marked them for extinction after modern humans—the makers of cave paintings and more advanced tools—arrived in Western Europe about 40,000 years ago. In recent years, however, research has begun to cast a more complimentary light on the older cousins.\nIn 1996, in a French cave, a Neandertal fossil was discovered lying next to pierced animal teeth, probably worn as pendants, and ivory rings. Some scientists have proposed that Neandertals flattered their newly arrived modern-human neighbors by imitating their more glamorous style of personal adornments. The scientists who made the 1996 finding suggested that Neandertals traded with modern humans. Other scientists have suggested that the Neandertals picked up ornaments from abandoned modern-human sites. But these ideas are disputed by anthropologist João Zilhão of the University of Lisbon in Portugal. His analysis of the ornaments and tools from the cave that yielded the 1996 discovery suggest methods and materials quite different from those attributed to modern humans.\nAnd if the Neandertals made their own pendants, perhaps to wear as some sort of social badge, they must have understood symbolism. “We do not know whether Neandertals developed the use of symbols independently or as a consequence of cultural contacts with anatomically modern humans,” anthropologist Francesco d’Errico says. “What we know is that their way of using symbols was not qualitatively different from that of anatomically modern humans, which contradicts the hypothesis of their cognitive inferiority.” d’Errico and his colleagues would even flip the established hierarchy, proposing the novel idea that Neandertals may have taught modern humans how to make some objects.\nMany anthropologists have assumed that Neandertals could not stock their own larders, but had to rely on the leftovers of others. Studies of animal bones from European caves indicate that they probably obtained animal flesh primarily by scavenging prey killed by carnivores, such as wolves, because most of these bones found at Neandertal sites came from the heads or feet of prey animals, which contain little meat. Interpreting piles of bones is a bit like assembling a jigsaw puzzle, though, and some researchers contend that these studies have overlooked the most important pieces, such as upper and lower leg bones, many of which, say Curtis Marean and his colleagues, show break and cut marks consistent with an emphasis on hunting.\nNot only did Neandertals hunt regularly, they crafted a varied arsenal, says archaeologist John Shea, of the State University of New York. His study of stone points from fifty-eight Neandertal sites shows both wood-tipped spears and stone-tipped spears, yielding the hypothesis that each type of tool was for a different kind of prey.\nTaken together, the studies leave researchers with many further mysteries to consider. Archaeological evidence for similarities between Neandertal and modern human behavior does not jibe with their distinct anatomies, which suggests to some researchers that the groups would have evolved different lifestyles. Many investigators now agree that anatomical differences alone cannot explain the Neandertals’ fate. But if the two groups’ behaviors were similar, why did Neandertals disappear?\n    Adapted from J.

Paragraphs 2 through 4, in particular, describe the complexity and flexibility of the Neandertals’ achievements.\nThe “well-adapted” part may be correct, but there is nothing in the passage about climate.

    "passage": "Passage 3 (Questions 13-17)\nSince 1856, when a thick-browed, human-like skull turned up in Germany’s Neander valley, the ancient people known as Neandertals have suffered a less-than-flattering reputation. Their greater muscle mass and simple tools contributed to their image as the brutish cousins of the human family. Although Neandertals’ brains were roughly the same size as those of modern people, they often have been portrayed as lacking the language skills, foresight, creativity, and other cognitive abilities of modern humans. In this view, the simpler ways of Neandertals marked them for extinction after modern humans—the makers of cave paintings and more advanced tools—arrived in Western Europe about 40,000 years ago. In recent years, however, research has begun to cast a more complimentary light on the older cousins.\nIn 1996, in a French cave, a Neandertal fossil was discovered lying next to pierced animal teeth, probably worn as pendants, and ivory rings. Some scientists have proposed that Neandertals flattered their newly arrived modern-human neighbors by imitating their more glamorous style of personal adornments. The scientists who made the 1996 finding suggested that Neandertals traded with modern humans. Other scientists have suggested that the Neandertals picked up ornaments from abandoned modern-human sites. But these ideas are disputed by anthropologist João Zilhão of the University of Lisbon in Portugal. His analysis of the ornaments and tools from the cave that yielded the 1996 discovery suggest methods and materials quite different from those attributed to modern humans.\nAnd if the Neandertals made their own pendants, perhaps to wear as some sort of social badge, they must have understood symbolism. “We do not know whether Neandertals developed the use of symbols independently or as a consequence of cultural contacts with anatomically modern humans,” anthropologist Francesco d’Errico says. “What we know is that their way of using symbols was not qualitatively different from that of anatomically modern humans, which contradicts the hypothesis of their cognitive inferiority.” d’Errico and his colleagues would even flip the established hierarchy, proposing the novel idea that Neandertals may have taught modern humans how to make some objects.\nMany anthropologists have assumed that Neandertals could not stock their own larders, but had to rely on the leftovers of others. Studies of animal bones from European caves indicate that they probably obtained animal flesh primarily by scavenging prey killed by carnivores, such as wolves, because most of these bones found at Neandertal sites came from the heads or feet of prey animals, which contain little meat. Interpreting piles of bones is a bit like assembling a jigsaw puzzle, though, and some researchers contend that these studies have overlooked the most important pieces, such as upper and lower leg bones, many of which, say Curtis Marean and his colleagues, show break and cut marks consistent with an emphasis on hunting.\nNot only did Neandertals hunt regularly, they crafted a varied arsenal, says archaeologist John Shea, of the State University of New York.

No novel, even one meant to be autobiographical, can be read in so naively literal a fashion, though it is evident from my mail that people do it all the time. Writers are far more cunning than the credulous reader supposes. We are all practiced shape-shifters and ventriloquists; we can assume forms and speak in voices not our own. We all have to have in some degree what Keats called negative capability, the capacity to make ourselves at home in other skins. Shakespeare had it supremely; he could speak with utter persuasiveness out of the mouth of Hotspur or Shylock, Iago or Hamlet or Juliet. Faulkner, too, had it supremely. You could no more reconstruct William Faulkner’s life or personality from his fiction than you could reconstruct Shakespeare from his plays. On the other hand, some writers have, or use, that capacity hardly at all. The fictions of Hemingway, Thomas Wolfe, and Katherine Anne Porter, for three, are haunted by recurring characters that look like clones of their authors.\nThe differences between those extremes of “objectivity” and “subjectivity” are obvious but not critical.

It sees only with the clarity that the writer is capable of, and it perpetuates the writer’s astigmatisms.” The main point of the paragraph, then, is that fiction demonstrates, or reproduces, both a writer’s strengths (or “clarity”) and weaknesses (or “astigmatisms”).\nThe author disputes the idea that a writer is even capable of being a “camera that perfectly reproduces real life.” Instead, he suggests that fiction reflects its author’s idiosyncratic perspective: “It sees only with the clarity that the writer is capable of, and it perpetuates the writer’s astigmatisms” (first paragraph).\nIn the first paragraph, the author describes the specificity of vision that characterizes each writer’s work, as he refutes Stendhal’s depiction of the writer as a “mirror” of reality. However, the paragraph does not focus on what makes fiction “fascinating,” and instead emphasizes the point that fiction reveals both a writer’s “clarity” of vision and his or her perceptual flaws.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

    "passage": "Passage 4 (Questions 18-22)\nOne page or six hundred, a fiction is more than a well-carpentered entertainment. It is also more than the mirror in the roadway that Stendhal said it was. Because a good writer is not really a mirror; a good writer is a lens. One mirror is like another, a mechanical reflector, but a lens may be anything from what is in your Instamatic to what makes you handle your Hasselblad with reverence. Ultimately there is no escaping the fact that fiction is only as good as its maker. It sees only with the clarity that the writer is capable of, and it perpetuates the writer’s astigmatisms.\nIt should make me nervous, and does, to talk about my own writing when both the writing I talk about and the things I say about it may reveal optical opacities or incapacities of which I am totally unaware. That sounds as if I were afraid of being found out, as if my fictions were either personal confessions or romans à clef, and that when an “I” character speaks in one of my novels or stories he is to be read as me, sneakily expressing my attitudes and feelings from behind a mask.\nWhich of course is irritating nonsense. No novel, even one meant to be autobiographical, can be read in so naively literal a fashion, though it is evident from my mail that people do it all the time. Writers are far more cunning than the credulous reader supposes. We are all practiced shape-shifters and ventriloquists; we can assume forms and speak in voices not our own. We all have to have in some degree what Keats called negative capability, the capacity to make ourselves at home in other skins. Shakespeare had it supremely; he could speak with utter persuasiveness out of the mouth of Hotspur or Shylock, Iago or Hamlet or Juliet. Faulkner, too, had it supremely. You could no more reconstruct William Faulkner’s life or personality from his fiction than you could reconstruct Shakespeare from his plays. On the other hand, some writers have, or use, that capacity hardly at all. The fictions of Hemingway, Thomas Wolfe, and Katherine Anne Porter, for three, are haunted by recurring characters that look like clones of their authors.\nThe differences between those extremes of “objectivity” and “subjectivity” are obvious but not critical. Some writers want to expose themselves, some to disguise themselves, some to efface themselves. Some who appear to expose themselves are distorting themselves for reasons of their own. There is more than one way to impose order on your personal chaos; but since good writers write what’s important to them, they are bound to be in there somewhere, as participants or observers or ombudsmen.\nIf there is a sense in which every piece of fiction is autobiographical, it is just as true that every autobiography is a fiction. A couple of years ago I had the disturbing experience of writing a brief autobiography for a reference book, and I noticed three things. One was the difficulty of getting my precious life into ten thousand words; the second was that I constantly had the feeling that I had written all this before; and the third was that on every page I had to restrain myself from inventing, elaborating. I was running a sack race, leg-bound by facts, whereas when I had rendered some of the same experiences as fiction I could be cavalier with them even while, in the interest of general truthfulness, I felt the impulse to tell them truly. And I don’t know which version is truer.\n    Adapted from W. Stegner, Where the Bluebird Sings to the Lemonade Springs: Living and Writing in the West. ©1992 the Author.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "your_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The solution is A.\nIn paragraph 4, the author enumerates the different ways in which writers may reveal themselves in their work: “Some writers want to expose themselves, some to disguise themselves, some to efface themselves.…There is more than one way to impose order on your personal chaos, but since good writers write what’s important to them, they are bound to be in there somewhere, as participants or observers or ombudsmen.” The point of the paragraph, then, is that writers do, in one way or another, ultimately reveal themselves in their work, and they may do this through a variety of means or strategies or approaches.\nThe author writes instead that “the differences between the extremes of ‘objectivity’ and ‘subjectivity’ are obvious but not critical.” This particular distinction, then, is not the main point of the paragraph.\nThe author does write that “there is more than one way to impose order on your personal chaos,” but this really suggests that everyone’s life or interior self has chaotic elements, not just writers’ lives. Further, that writers write to impose “order” on “chaos” is not the primary point of the paragraph.\nThis is not the main point of the paragraph, which says explicitly that different writers seek to be “visible” in their own work to different degrees: “Some writers want to expose themselves, some to disguise themselves, some to efface themselves.”\nKhan Academy Lessons",

    "passage": "Passage 5 (Questions 23-29)\nSince the early twentieth century, most successful Broadway musicals have been adaptations of some kind. Their creators took it for granted, however, that the shows were essentially original works of popular art and did not depend on the familiarity of the audience with the source material (whether it was a novel, short story, or memoir); creators typically treated source material with great freedom and latitude. These musicals were usually given brand-new titles, to emphasize their originality.\n“Commodity musicals,” on the other hand, are shows based on commercially successful, well-remembered movies (or, less frequently, television series). Their target audience is those who know and love the movies. To attract these viewers, the musicals bear the titles of the films from which they are adapted and are closely based on their screenplays. The shows may also be cast to evoke their source material: the stars of the stage version of 9 to 5, for example, bore an unmistakable resemblance to their on-screen models. For the most part, such shows lack the vitality that made the musical so central to American theater in the twentieth century. They are inoffensively entertaining at best, numbingly tedious at worst.\nWhy, then, have commodity musicals come to dominate the Broadway stage, home to the most prestigious and lucrative theaters in the United States? For one thing, producers view these musicals as safer investments than more original, less predictable fare. In 1968, the year Promises, Promises opened, the top ticket price on Broadway was $11 ($75 in twenty-first century dollars). By contrast, today’s top price is about $140.\nAnother reason is that Broadway songwriters can no longer rely on a common musical language. The scores of the mid-twentieth century Broadway musicals that comprised Broadway’s “golden age” were all written in the same idiom, an amalgam of European operetta, ragtime, and early jazz that was for many years the common language of American popular music. When rock and roll supplanted that style in the mid-1960s, Broadway failed to keep up with the times, and now that even rock and roll has lost its short-lived status as a common language, there is no longer a universally popular musical language in which theatrical songwriters can work. It is thus even harder for songwriters to appeal to the public at large, which increases the likelihood that they will embrace the commodity musical out of necessity.\nFor these two reasons, the rise of the commodity-musical genre represents a major setback for the Broadway musical. Such shows crowd out the competition because they are safe, thus making it more difficult for songwriters to work on Broadway without conforming to their restrictive requirements.\nWhat can be done to make it easier for original shows to flourish on Broadway? Nothing. Even revivals of popular non-musical plays typically require the presence of a movie or television star to be financially viable. It costs too much to bring any other kind of show to Broadway.\nThe rise of the commodity musical, then, is at least as much a symptom as it is a disease. In any case, it will probably not be cured in our lifetimes. Although theater in the U.S. remains vital, the center of that vitality is now to be found off Broadway and in theaters outside of New York. The old-fashioned Broadway musical, with its optimism and burgeoning musical energy, is gone for good, replaced for the moment—and very possibly for a long time to come—by a watered-down, parasitical imitation of the real thing.\n    Adapted from T.

    "passage": "Passage 5 (Questions 23-29)\nSince the early twentieth century, most successful Broadway musicals have been adaptations of some kind. Their creators took it for granted, however, that the shows were essentially original works of popular art and did not depend on the familiarity of the audience with the source material (whether it was a novel, short story, or memoir); creators typically treated source material with great freedom and latitude. These musicals were usually given brand-new titles, to emphasize their originality.\n“Commodity musicals,” on the other hand, are shows based on commercially successful, well-remembered movies (or, less frequently, television series). Their target audience is those who know and love the movies. To attract these viewers, the musicals bear the titles of the films from which they are adapted and are closely based on their screenplays. The shows may also be cast to evoke their source material: the stars of the stage version of 9 to 5, for example, bore an unmistakable resemblance to their on-screen models. For the most part, such shows lack the vitality that made the musical so central to American theater in the twentieth century. They are inoffensively entertaining at best, numbingly tedious at worst.\nWhy, then, have commodity musicals come to dominate the Broadway stage, home to the most prestigious and lucrative theaters in the United States? For one thing, producers view these musicals as safer investments than more original, less predictable fare. In 1968, the year Promises, Promises opened, the top ticket price on Broadway was $11 ($75 in twenty-first century dollars). By contrast, today’s top price is about $140.\nAnother reason is that Broadway songwriters can no longer rely on a common musical language. The scores of the mid-twentieth century Broadway musicals that comprised Broadway’s “golden age” were all written in the same idiom, an amalgam of European operetta, ragtime, and early jazz that was for many years the common language of American popular music. When rock and roll supplanted that style in the mid-1960s, Broadway failed to keep up with the times, and now that even rock and roll has lost its short-lived status as a common language, there is no longer a universally popular musical language in which theatrical songwriters can work. It is thus even harder for songwriters to appeal to the public at large, which increases the likelihood that they will embrace the commodity musical out of necessity.\nFor these two reasons, the rise of the commodity-musical genre represents a major setback for the Broadway musical. Such shows crowd out the competition because they are safe, thus making it more difficult for songwriters to work on Broadway without conforming to their restrictive requirements.\nWhat can be done to make it easier for original shows to flourish on Broadway? Nothing. Even revivals of popular non-musical plays typically require the presence of a movie or television star to be financially viable. It costs too much to bring any other kind of show to Broadway.\nThe rise of the commodity musical, then, is at least as much a symptom as it is a disease. In any case, it will probably not be cured in our lifetimes.

    "passage": "Passage 6 (Questions 30-36)\nPlato taught that the corrupting influence of the arts justified their banishment from his ideal city. His argument hinged on a conviction that the emotions are irrational, in the sense that they undermine the rule of reason in the individual and, in consequence, in society. His presupposition was that reason and emotion are opposed. In addressing the emotions, Plato concluded, drama or works of art address irrational tendencies and thus undermine our ability to control ourselves through reason.\nContemporary psychology and analytic philosophy reject Plato’s presupposition. The prevalent view is that reason is an ineradicable constituent of the emotions. But in order to be certain that emotion is not an irrational force, we need a clear conception of its nature. One plausible definition is that an emotion is a physiological condition. Hormonal changes occur as one enters an emotional state—the adrenal glands produce corticosteroids, which in turn induce the multiple changes associated with agitation and readiness for action. When one is angry, one’s blood flow increases, and one may feel “hot under the collar.” One may also sense an altered heart rate, an expansion or contraction of the chest, muscular tension. English speakers implicitly acknowledge such sensations in referring to emotions as “feelings.”\nEmotions are not simply bodily sensations, however. Suppose that the set of physiological changes you experienced the last time you were angry is chemically induced. You are then left alone in exactly the feeling state you were in at a meeting the previous month, after a colleague spoke to you sarcastically. Are you angry? No, you are only uneasy, restless—unless there is someone or something giving you cause for anger. Your colleague’s rudeness does not come to mind. The chemicals have induced only symptoms of emotion.\nThis demonstration implies that emotion requires at least two components: measurable physiological events and a belief or thought about some person or situation, real or imagined. Moreover, there is evidence that even strong emotions possess a sort of rationality—that is, they are governed by thought, and they are educable. We try to convince a child not to fear an imagined monster underneath the bed by proving that no monster is there. Similarly, if an object of anger is found innocent of hostile intentions, then the anger typically evaporates.\nEmotions have criteria of appropriateness that are open to assessment; they are naturally responsive to reason and knowledge. The penetrability of emotional responses by thought means that art does not necessarily undermine reason in addressing the emotions. Indeed, because of the immediacy of its activation, the reactive component of emotion may serve the reflective component by directing attention to information of importance to us.\nEmotion is a vital part of our biological heritage. This fact does not mean that emotions are impervious to culture. It means that the universality of human emotions can be explained by principles of natural selection. We have emotions because, like thumbs, an upright posture, and a convoluted cerebral cortex, they contribute to the survival of our species.\nThe emotions elicited by art do not subvert human reason, since reason—memory, associative conceptualization, judgment—is an inextricable constituent, indeed a determining force, of such responses. But although Plato was mistaken in believing that all representative creations threaten reason, some emotion-producing representations—those that encourage defective cognitive states—are affronts to reason. That is, the only danger of art to society is not that it excites the passions but that it may instill false beliefs. Plato’s general argument about art must be rejected.\n    Adapted from N.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "your_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The solution is A.\nIn challenging Plato’s view that emotions are irrational and thus dangerous, the author writes, “Moreover, there is evidence that even strong emotions possess a sort of rationality—that is, they are governed by thought, and they are educable. We try to convince a child not to fear an imagined monster underneath the bed by proving that no monster is there” (paragraph 4). If, however, the child’s fear persisted despite such assurances, and the fear that persisted was “instinctual and beyond the child’s control,” this would challenge the author’s claim that reason is a component of emotion and that emotion can be taught or corrected.\nIf the child who fears the monster does not believe that the adults are able to see the monster, then the child is not able to trust the adults as a source of information. This does not undermine the author’s argument that reason is a component of emotion and that emotion can be modified by reason—the child is just not yet persuaded by the adults’ argument because he or she does not yet trust its basis.\nIf the child does not believe that the adults who are speaking to him or her are trustworthy, this suggests that the child is using reason to discount the information that the adults are giving him or her. This does not mean that if the child comes to trust the adults, that the child’s emotion will not ultimately be “educable.”\nIf the fear that the child experiences is a result of separation anxiety—a form of emotion—this does not undermine or invalidate the author’s contention that such fear can be susceptible to modification by education. The fear, regardless of its source, could still be subject to modification.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

    "your_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The solution is D.\nWithout the physiological dimension of anger, as described in paragraph 2, one would experience anger less intensely, rather than more intensely, than if it were present.\nThe author contends that there are “at least two components” of emotion: “measurable physiological events and a belief or thought about some person or situation” (paragraph 4). With the measurable physiological dimension of emotion withdrawn, participants in the described experiment would not have a “normal” response to the situation—the physiological dimension of their anger, as described in paragraph 2, would be absent.\nThe author indicates that “a belief or thought about some person or situation” (paragraph 4) is one component of emotion. If this component is present, then “indifference” or “inattention”—a lack of emotion—is unlikely to result, based on the author’s model.\nThe author contends that, “emotion requires at least two components: measurable physiological events and a belief or thought about some person or situation, real or imagined” (paragraph 4). If the physiological element of the emotion were withdrawn from the experience, but an event likely to incite anger was still present, then the participants would be without the “agitation” the author describes as associated with anger in paragraph 2. Participants would still assess the situation negatively, though, as the “belief or thought about some person or situation” would still be present (paragraph 4).\nKhan Academy Lessons",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "your_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The solution is B.\nPaint is an essential component of painting, the material that allows one to produce a painting. By contrast, in Plato’s view, emotion corrupts reason; it does not enable it.\nThe author describes Plato’s belief that the arts had a corrupting influence on society: “His argument hinged on a conviction that the emotions are irrational, in the sense that they undermine the rule of reason in the individual and, in consequence, in society…. Plato concluded [that] works of art address irrational tendencies and thus undermine our ability to control ourselves through reason” (first paragraph). In the author’s description, Plato clearly sees the “controlled” state that reason brings as the desirable (or healthy) state, and the “irrational” role of emotion as the disease that threatens health.\nIn Plato’s view, emotion is the irrational element that threatens the healthy, socially beneficial operations of reason. The relation between body and soul is different: body might be described as the corporeal element of the self, while the soul is the spiritual or ineffable element of the self. The two elements are both separate and conjoined; the element of body does not threaten the soul.\nWater is the precursor to ice; it can be transformed into ice at a low enough temperature. Plato, as the author describes him, does not believe that emotion can be made into reason; emotion, rather, threatens to undermine or dismantle reason.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

    "correct_answer": "A",

No, you are only uneasy, restless—unless there is something or someone giving you cause for anger” (paragraph 3). The author implies that “something or someone” is necessary to make a feeling (a sensation) into an emotion, which suggests that an emotion indeed concerns a “specific object or situation.”\nThe author uses the example of chemically inducing a feeling state (paragraph 3) to differentiate a simple feeling from an emotion. That is, the author indicates that this chemically produced state is insufficient to create an emotion, which needs “something or someone” to attach to it.\nThe author describes the contention that “emotion is a physiological condition” (paragraph 2), in order to argue that this is not an adequate definition of an emotion: “Emotions are not simply bodily sensations” (paragraph 3). The difference between emotion and feeling for the author is that an emotion requires not only physiological changes, but also a “belief or thought about some person or situation.”\nThe author discusses emotion as it is a component of a reaction or response to art—not as it plays a role in the creative process. Further, the role of art in the creative process is not part of the distinction the author makes between emotion and feelings.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

    "passage": "Passage 7 (Questions 37-41)\nIn 1967, Stanley Milgram described a “small world” experience of two strangers who met in Tunisia and discovered that they shared a common acquaintance in Detroit. Milgram then conducted a small-world experiment that took this idea a step further: Subjects in the experiment could reach anyone in the country, maybe anyone on the planet, through a chain of no more than six people or “six degrees of separation.”\nIn the intervening decades, Milgram’s findings slipped away from their scientific moorings and sailed into the world of imagination. The idea of six degrees of separation was adopted by the intelligentsia, and it has turned up in the media and movies. But Milgram’s startling conclusion has scanty evidence. The idea of six degrees of separation may, in fact, be plain wrong—the academic equivalent of an urban myth.\nIn his experiment, Milgram asked “starters” from places such as Nebraska to mail a folder to a target person in major cities, such as Boston. The starters had to get the folder to someone they knew on a first-name basis. That person was to send the folder to someone closer to the target, and so forth. Incredibly, Milgram reported that there are “six degrees of separation” between any two people: It took only five people in six jumps to get the folder from the starter to the targeted stranger.\nA closer look at Milgram’s papers on the small-world study reveal that few of his folders reached their targets. In his first, unpublished study, only three of sixty letters—5 percent—made it. Even in Milgram’s published studies, less than 30 percent of the folders got through. Since then, only a few replications that actually spanned cities have been done. Of these trials, few folders made it through, especially across class and race boundaries.\nPerhaps people didn’t bother sending the letters on. That was Milgram’s explanation. The folder, however, was not a simple chain letter, but an official-looking document with heavy blue binding and a gold logo. If the subjects knew how to reach the targets, they probably would have.\nThere is some evidence that Milgram might be right despite his own research. Duncan Watts and his colleagues at Columbia University have created mathematical models that show how a small world could work. Random connectors in a network, such as especially sociable people who have friends across subcultures, can vastly decrease the distance between points in a network.\nIt is just as likely that Milgram was wrong. But if we don’t live in a small world after all, why do people find this idea so easy to believe? One suggestion is that the belief in a small world gives people a sense of security. And small-world experiences that we encounter naturally buttress people’s religious faith as evidence of “design.”\nThere is also a difference between what most people mean by a small-world experience and what mathematicians mean. The chances of meeting a person who knows someone from one’s past are not the same as the chances of connection between two people taken at random. Over a lifetime, the chances of meeting a person that one knew in the past are high, especially for educated people who travel in similar networks.\nAnd when an especially unlikely connection occurs, the world does feel small, whether or not the scientific evidence agrees.\n    Adapted from J.

    "passage": "Passage 7 (Questions 37-41)\nIn 1967, Stanley Milgram described a “small world” experience of two strangers who met in Tunisia and discovered that they shared a common acquaintance in Detroit. Milgram then conducted a small-world experiment that took this idea a step further: Subjects in the experiment could reach anyone in the country, maybe anyone on the planet, through a chain of no more than six people or “six degrees of separation.”\nIn the intervening decades, Milgram’s findings slipped away from their scientific moorings and sailed into the world of imagination. The idea of six degrees of separation was adopted by the intelligentsia, and it has turned up in the media and movies. But Milgram’s startling conclusion has scanty evidence. The idea of six degrees of separation may, in fact, be plain wrong—the academic equivalent of an urban myth.\nIn his experiment, Milgram asked “starters” from places such as Nebraska to mail a folder to a target person in major cities, such as Boston. The starters had to get the folder to someone they knew on a first-name basis. That person was to send the folder to someone closer to the target, and so forth. Incredibly, Milgram reported that there are “six degrees of separation” between any two people: It took only five people in six jumps to get the folder from the starter to the targeted stranger.\nA closer look at Milgram’s papers on the small-world study reveal that few of his folders reached their targets. In his first, unpublished study, only three of sixty letters—5 percent—made it. Even in Milgram’s published studies, less than 30 percent of the folders got through. Since then, only a few replications that actually spanned cities have been done. Of these trials, few folders made it through, especially across class and race boundaries.\nPerhaps people didn’t bother sending the letters on. That was Milgram’s explanation. The folder, however, was not a simple chain letter, but an official-looking document with heavy blue binding and a gold logo. If the subjects knew how to reach the targets, they probably would have.\nThere is some evidence that Milgram might be right despite his own research. Duncan Watts and his colleagues at Columbia University have created mathematical models that show how a small world could work. Random connectors in a network, such as especially sociable people who have friends across subcultures, can vastly decrease the distance between points in a network.\nIt is just as likely that Milgram was wrong. But if we don’t live in a small world after all, why do people find this idea so easy to believe? One suggestion is that the belief in a small world gives people a sense of security. And small-world experiences that we encounter naturally buttress people’s religious faith as evidence of “design.”\nThere is also a difference between what most people mean by a small-world experience and what mathematicians mean. The chances of meeting a person who knows someone from one’s past are not the same as the chances of connection between two people taken at random. Over a lifetime, the chances of meeting a person that one knew in the past are high, especially for educated people who travel in similar networks.\nAnd when an especially unlikely connection occurs, the world does feel small, whether or not the scientific evidence agrees.\n    Adapted from J.

    "question_text": "A researcher applying Watts’s mathematical models as described in the passage to research on the transmission of an airborne contagious disease can most reasonably assume that:",
    "answer_choices": "A. a small number of individuals could cause a widespread distribution of the disease.\nB. all infected individuals would contribute equally to the distribution of the disease.\nC. widespread disease transmission is more likely in a society with many isolated subcultures.\nD. disease transmission among individuals who do not know each other is highly unlikely.",
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "your_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The solution is A.\nThe author writes that Watts and colleagues at Columbia “have created mathematical models that show how a small world could work. Random connectors in a network, such as especially sociable people who have friends across subcultures, can vastly decrease the distance between points in a network” (paragraph 6). These “random connectors,” who can be a small number of strategically connected people, can have a disproportionate impact on the possibility of transmitting the folders. This would be analogous to a small number of people helping to transmit a disease more “efficiently.”\nTo the contrary, Watts’s work shows the disproportionate impact of “random connectors, such as especially sociable people who have friends across subcultures” (paragraph 6). This would not imply that everyone contributes equally to disease distribution.\nTo the contrary, Watts’s work suggests that it is not “isolated” subcultures that contribute to the transmission of information. Rather it is the possibility of creating links to and among those subcultures that increases the chance of information—or disease—transmission.\nWatts’s research shows, instead, how a “small world could work,” especially when certain “random connectors,” who are particularly sociable, are able to form connectors across subcultures. Thus, applying Watts’s mathematical models would show that disease transmission among individuals who do not know each other is possible under certain circumstances. The model does not support a suggestion that such transmission is “highly unlikely.”\nKhan Academy Lessons",

Nowhere did Spencer have a larger following than in the United States, where his works were celebrated as powerful justifications for laissez-faire capitalism. Competition was preordained; its result was progress; and institutions that stood in the way of individual liberties violated the natural order. Thanks to Spencer, Victorian capitalists knew that nature was on their side.\nSpencer detested public speaking, and he no longer needed money, thanks to the immense popularity of his books. A lifelong hypochondriac who had suffered a nervous breakdown in 1856, he had come to the U.S. to reinvigorate his “greatly disordered nervous system,” and he withstood all inducements to what he called “social excitement.” But the press of distinguished American Spencerians was irresistible, and he agreed to attend a banquet at a prominent New York restaurant.\nSenators, captains of industry, and professors were there in force. The Secretary of State called Spencer the smartest man in the world. An army general declared that there would have been no Civil War if the South had studied Spencer’s principles.

    "explanation": "The solution is A.\nThe author writes, “Nowhere did Spencer have a larger following than in the U.S., where his works were celebrated as powerful justifications for laissez-faire capitalism” (first paragraph). The author, then, implicitly attributes Spencer’s popularity in the U.S. to his support for capitalism, and it follows that those who were prospering under this system would be the ones who found this support most attractive.\nThere is no evidence in the passage that those in the U.S. who admired Spencer had particular knowledge of Darwin. Although the passage indicates that Spencer was “well known as an evolutionist,” it also says that this was true “long before” Darwin’s On the Origin of Species was published” (paragraph 5). Thus, Spencer’s reputation as an evolutionist did not hinge on his affiliation with Darwin.\nAlthough the first paragraph supports the claim that Spencer’s following in the U.S. was due in part to the relatively large number of affluent residents in the country, the passage does not support the claim that a relatively strong sense of social responsibility contributes to Spencer’s following. To the contrary, the author describes Spencer as promulgating a very limited view of social responsibility: “Governments had no obligation, or even right, to compel vaccination or education, keep small children from sweeping chimneys, mandate the construction of sewers, or relieve poverty” (paragraph 6). If Spencer advocated such views about the limits of social responsibility, there is no reason to attribute Spencer’s popularity to a “relatively strong sense of social responsibility” pervasive in the U.S.\nThe passage does not support the claim that a relatively strong sense of social responsibility contributed to Spencer’s following; to the contrary, paragraph 6 shows that Spencer promoted a very limited view of social responsibility.

The author also indicates explicitly in the first paragraph that Spencer supported competition, so he would not have believed that Americans over-valued that quality at the expense of hard work.\nThe passage clearly indicates that Spencer “admired [the] material achievements of American capitalism” (paragraph 4), and there is no suggestion that he frowned on ostentation.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

Yes; it weakens the claim that Darwin restricted his theories to the biological domain.\nC. Yes; it supports the characterization of Darwin as a “biological Spencerian.”\nD. Yes; it supports the university president’s praise of Spencer’s “powerful intellect.”",
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "your_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The solution is C.\nAlthough the phrase “survival of the fittest” is not mentioned in the passage, the passage does characterize Spencer as “well-known as an evolutionist long before Darwin’s On the Origin of Species was published” (paragraph 5). And the same paragraph goes on to contrast the social relevance or reach of the ideas of Spencer and Darwin. The scenario described in the item stem is indeed relevant to the passage.\nEven if Spencer, rather than Darwin, had coined the expression “survival of the fittest,” and then Darwin had adopted the expression, this would not weaken the passage claim that Darwin confined his theories to the biological realm (as paragraph 5 indicates that Darwin does).\nThe author writes: “Spencer was well-known as an evolutionist long before Darwin’s On the Origin of Species was published, but while Darwin resisted applying the idea to morals, society, or politics, Spencer saw evolution working everywhere. He has been tagged as a social Darwinist, but it is more correct to think of Darwin as a biological Spencerian” (paragraph 5). The author, then, attributes some primacy in terms of the reach of his ideas to Spencer over Darwin (and indicates that his renown preceded that of Darwin’s great work). The counter-factual scenario described in the stem, in which Spencer coined the expression “survival of the fittest,” would further support the description of Darwin as a follower of Spencer, rather than the other way around.\nThe passage describes the banquet Spencer attended, where the “president of Columbia University announced that Spencer was ‘the most powerful intellect of all time.’” (paragraph 3). Even if Spencer, rather than Darwin, had coined the expression “survival of the fittest,” however, that fact would not necessarily support this hyperbolic claim.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

    "question_number": 108,
    "passage": "Passage 9 (Questions 49-53)\nWhere are the supremely gifted artists of America and Western Europe today? Generally, today’s mainstream art is not very good, and the works that are good are certainly not great. There are good artists around—that is not the issue—but these artists just amuse us for a moment or intrigue us for an hour.\nDuring the last century, and especially since the 1970s, we have been witnessing a depletion that is periodically visited upon a civilization’s powers of creativity. Such moments are like economic recessions, except that they strike far less frequently and are more deeply entrenched when they do. This depletion occurred at the end of the fourteenth century, the end of the seventeenth century, and the first half of the nineteenth century. Not every age can bring forth works of genius, and maybe the final decades of the nineteenth century, having nurtured so many splendid monuments to the imagination, earned for art the right to rest for a century.\nBut whatever the history of our artistic recession, its immediate cause is precisely the pervasive and unchecked reverence in which art is held by the critics. The most striking feature of recent artistic discourse, the quality that sets it apart from all earlier discussion, is its chronic unwillingness to address the weaknesses inherent in the productions of our artists. For example, in a recent Weekend section of the New York Times, which probably devotes more space to art than does any other nonspecialized publication, all ten gallery reviews were favorable, even though the praise tended to be of the tepid, hedging, irresolute variety. One can hardly imagine the book, film, theater, music, or even food critics of the Times succumbing to such a degree of chinlessness. Yet this timidity is fairly typical of art criticism in our day. Critics have somehow reconceptualized themselves as midwives to the artistic process, whose task it is to encourage artists and respectfully offer them suggestions. To sit in judgment on works of art is not their job.\nThis mindset begins to make sense when one considers that critics have traditionally missed the point about the best art of their generation. Remember the outcries against Courbet, Monet, van Gogh, Picasso, and Pollock, whom most contemporary critics savaged with remorseless merriment. In reviewing the past, one can distinguish two prototypes of the art critic: John Ruskin, the angry reactionary, and Baudelaire, the sensitive, forward-looking friend of art. Because the Baudelaires of the world have been right far more often than the Ruskins, everyone now tries to be Baudelaire. Never, critics resolve, will they miss the boat as embarrassingly as their predecessors did when confronted with impressionism and cubism. Better that a thousand nonentities should be heralded as the new Picasso than that the new Picasso should meet with scorn or neglect!\nThis attitude has spread to the American public, at least those fifteen million who take an interest in art. Who is to decide what is good art and bad art? they will ask. Isn’t it true that van Gogh sold only one painting in his lifetime? Like the critics, they are absolutely resolved not to be part of the philistine majority capable of assuming that a seven-year-old could paint a Picasso. No, this generation of art lovers is emphatically in the select group that gets the point. As a result, the more fervid their interest in art, the less confident they are of their ability to view it with the necessary discernment. And so the free fall of art continues, with no end in sight.\n    Adapted from J. Gardner, Culture or Trash? A Provocative View of Contemporary Painting, Sculpture, and Other Costly Commitments. ©1993 by J. Gardner.",

The author, then, perceives a dearth of creativity, and does not argue that critics over-value creativity, but that they are too accepting of the art that does exist.\nThe author maintains that what he characterizes as the “timidity…of art criticism of our day” (paragraph 3) comes out of a fear of misunderstanding or overlooking art that may come to be evaluated by future generations as “great art.” He describes what he sees as behind the fearful mindset of contemporary critics: “Never, critics resolve, will they miss the boat as embarrassingly as their predecessors did when confronted with impressionism and cubism. Better a thousand nonentities should be heralded as the new Picasso than that the new Picasso should be met with scorn or neglect!” (paragraph 4).\nThis is not supported by the passage.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

This depletion occurred at the end of the fourteenth century, the end of the seventeenth century, and the first half of the nineteenth century. Not every age can bring forth works of genius, and maybe the final decades of the nineteenth century, having nurtured so many splendid monuments to the imagination, earned for art the right to rest for a century.\nBut whatever the history of our artistic recession, its immediate cause is precisely the pervasive and unchecked reverence in which art is held by the critics. The most striking feature of recent artistic discourse, the quality that sets it apart from all earlier discussion, is its chronic unwillingness to address the weaknesses inherent in the productions of our artists.

    "answer_choices": "A. Its analogy between art and a recession would be false.\nB. Its wish for real critical debate would be encouraged.\nC. Its discouraging conclusion would not be justified.\nD. Its disparaging remarks would apply to more people.",
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "your_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The solution is D.\nThe proportion of Americans interested in the fine art now being produced is irrelevant to the applicability or “truth” of the author’s analogy between the state of art and the state of the economy (paragraph 2).\nThe author does not suggest that the cause of a lack of real critical debate about art is a lack of people interested in art. Rather, the author says that the problem is critical “timidity,” a fear of passing negative judgment on art that is later received as great art.\nTo the contrary, the author’s negative conclusion applies precisely to those “fifteen million who take an interest in art” (final paragraph). If most Americans were interested in the fine art now being produced, this would merely extend the reach of the author’s discouraging conclusion that art lovers, in particular, are afraid to make critical judgments, as they live in fear of failing to understand the work of an artist who will later be viewed as a genius of some kind.\nThe author writes in the final paragraph, “This attitude [fearing to make a negative judgment about art that could later be assessed as ‘great’] has spread to the American public, at least those fifteen million who take an interest in art…. As a result, the more fervid their interest in art, the less confident they are of their ability to view it with the necessary discernment” (final paragraph). If there were more Americans interested in art, this opinion would simply apply more widely, because the author suggests it applies to all who are interested in art. The author does say that those who are interested in art want to avoid being part of the “philistine majority” who believe that any young child could “paint a Picasso” (final paragraph). Were “most” Americans interested in art, this concern with being part of the “majority” would be less salient, but an interest in belonging to a “select” group is ultimately less central to the author’s argument than is the general fear among those interested in art of overlooking genius.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

    "explanation": "The solution is C.\nIf some critics have always expressed strong opinions about what makes art both good and bad, this might qualify the author’s assessment that the overvaluing of art by critics has “spread to the American public” (final paragraph). It would not support the claim that the author has “correctly assessed the gullibility” of that public.\nEven if “some critics have always expressed strong opinions” about what makes art good and bad, this doesn’t mean that the passage author’s description of the unfailingly positive gallery reviews in “a recent Weekend section of the New York Times” (paragraph 3) is mistaken.\nMuch of the passage is devoted to the argument that it is the “timidity” of critics, their hesitance to take a strong aesthetic stand and to criticize as well as praise artists, that has contributed to the “depletion” of the quality of contemporary art: “But whatever the history of our artistic recession, its immediate cause is precisely the pervasive and unchecked reverence in which art is held by the critics” (paragraph 3). If, however, some critics have indeed always expressed strong opinions about what makes art both good and bad, and the artistic “recession” has nonetheless occurred (in the author’s view, in any case), then it is likely that the author is overestimating the impact of critics on the quality of artistic production.\nWhatever the critics may have said about the qualities that produce good (or bad) art, this does not have any kind of necessary effect on the actual merits of contemporary art, nor on the appropriateness of the author’s judgment about this art.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

STAT5b homodimers are then translocated to the nucleus where they act as transcription factors.\nOne important target tissue of GH is the liver, where GH regulates expression of the cytochrome P450 (P450s) genes. P450s are major drug-metabolizing enzymes, and the gene expression of some P450s is up-regulated by the presence of continuous GH. This results in sex differences in the metabolism of some drugs.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "your_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The solution is A.\nThis is the only graph that correctly illustrates a quicker metabolism—or shorter half-life—of erythromycin in females. Given the continuous presence of GH in females, the cytochrome P450 enzymes are up-regulated, resulting in more rapid metabolism of certain drugs (like erythromycin). As a result, the half-life of erythromycin is expected to be lower in females (in other words, it would take less time to metabolize the drug due to the greater presence of P450 enzymes).\nIn this graph, both the males and females have the same relative half-life. The passage indicates that in the continuous presence of GH in females, the cytochrome P450 enzymes are continuously up-regulated. Thus, there is a difference of half-life between the males and females.\nIn this graph, both the males and females have the same relative half-life. The passage indicates that in the continuous presence of GH in females, the cytochrome P450 enzymes are continuously up-regulated. Thus, there is a difference of half-life between the males and females.\nThe passage indicates that in the continuous presence of GH in females, the cytochrome P450 enzymes are continuously up-regulated. Thus, there is a difference of half-life between the males and females: there will be reduced, not increased, erythromycin half-life in females.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

    "passage": "Passage 1 (Questions 1-4)\nIn rats, growth hormone (GH) is secreted from the pituitary gland in a sexually dimorphic manner. In adult male rats, GH secretion takes place in discrete pulses or a pulsatile pattern (one pulse approximately every 3.5 hours) with little to no GH detectable between pulses. Conversely, in adult female rats, GH secretion is more frequent, producing a continuous, high GH presence in the circulation (though at lower levels than peak levels observed in males). These sex-dependent patterns of GH release are induced by gonadal steroids. For instance, when male rats are treated with estrogen they exhibit the female pattern of GH release.\nGH acts on target tissues through a transmembrane receptor that undergoes a conformational change upon GH binding. The intracellular tail of the receptor then activates a tyrosine kinase known as Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2). JAK2 phosphorylates the tail of the GH receptor on several tyrosine residues, thereby forming a docking site for molecules that have phosphotyrosine-binding domains, such as STAT5b. JAK2 then phosphorylates receptor-associated STAT5b molecules, which subsequently dimerize with other molecules of phosphorylated STAT5b. STAT5b homodimers are then translocated to the nucleus where they act as transcription factors.\nOne important target tissue of GH is the liver, where GH regulates expression of the cytochrome P450 (P450s) genes.

Figure 1 shows that the levels of circulating ghrelin are higher in lean individuals than in obese individuals with no underlying conditions. Additionally, lean individuals have lower, not greater, metabolic needs than obese individuals.\nObese individuals have more energy stores than lean individual. For this reason, the levels of ghrelin, which increases appetite, are lower in obese individuals.\nAlthough it is true that lean individuals have lower metabolic needs than obese individuals, it is the stomach and small intestine that secrete ghrelin, not the hypothalamus.\nGhrelin secretion is suppressed in obese individuals.

    "passage": "Passage 8 (Questions 40-44)\nNormal body functions depend on the presence of an optimal amount of water. Three types of receptors detect changes in body water: the osmoreceptors, volume receptors, and oral “thirst” receptors. Osmoreceptors are cells in the brain (and perhaps in the liver) that are sensitive to changes in the osmotic pressure (osmolarity) of body fluids. Volume receptors are located in the cardiac atria and vena cavae, and detect changes in the volume of blood. Oral receptors mediate the sense of thirst, which is noticed as a dry mouth. All three receptor types could act simultaneously. For example, dehydration induces thirst sensations and a decrease in body fluid volume simultaneously with an increase in blood osmolarity. The usual response to dehydration is to drink to restore blood volume and osmolarity to normal.\nWhich of these receptors is most important in the normal stimulation of drinking behavior? To answer this question, an experiment was conducted with five healthy human volunteers. The blood osmolarity and blood volume of these subjects were measured as they went about their normal daily activities between 9 AM and 7 PM. They were allowed to drink (water only) and eat as they wished, but they were asked to rate how thirsty they felt at times just before drinking and at other times during the day when they were not thirsty. The results of average responses are shown in Figure 1, which compares values during one hour just before the subjects drank with values at times when they were not inclined to drink.\nFigure 1 Three factors measured during one hour just before drinking (D) compared with one hour when subjects were not drinking (ND) (Note: Thirst rating = subjective rating of thirst sensation from not thirsty (40) to very thirsty (80).)",
    "question_text": "On the day of the experiment, the subjects drank about 1 L of water on average and excreted about 400 mL of urine. The most likely explanation for the difference between water intake and urine excretion is that:",
    "answer_choices": "A. the extra water was stored as blood.\nB. water was consumed with the food that was eaten.\nC. the extra water was excreted by the intestine.\nD. water was excreted via the skin and the lungs.",
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "your_answer": "Unknown",
    "explanation": "The solution is D.\nThe extra water cannot be stored as blood because this would increase the blood volume.\nIf the water was consumed with the food that was eaten, then it would be absorbed and accumulate in circulation, increasing the volume of blood.\nExtra water could be excreted through the intestine if the subjects were having diarrhea. As the passage does not indicate this condition, this answer is not likely.\nExtra water is normally excreted through skin and lungs. The skin excretes water through the process of transpiration, and the lungs use water to humidify the air that enters the body.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

    "passage": "Passage 8 (Questions 40-44)\nNormal body functions depend on the presence of an optimal amount of water. Three types of receptors detect changes in body water: the osmoreceptors, volume receptors, and oral “thirst” receptors. Osmoreceptors are cells in the brain (and perhaps in the liver) that are sensitive to changes in the osmotic pressure (osmolarity) of body fluids. Volume receptors are located in the cardiac atria and vena cavae, and detect changes in the volume of blood. Oral receptors mediate the sense of thirst, which is noticed as a dry mouth. All three receptor types could act simultaneously. For example, dehydration induces thirst sensations and a decrease in body fluid volume simultaneously with an increase in blood osmolarity. The usual response to dehydration is to drink to restore blood volume and osmolarity to normal.\nWhich of these receptors is most important in the normal stimulation of drinking behavior? To answer this question, an experiment was conducted with five healthy human volunteers.

When anticipating an aversive event, Ps fail to show increased skin conductivity (measured by an increase in moisture) that is typical in controls, and they are less likely to exhibit the startle response when presented with fear-inducing pictures. In lexical decision tasks which ask participants to decide whether a string of letters is a word, Ps respond similarly to emotional and non-emotional words, whereas controls tend to respond more quickly to emotional words.\nPs also differ from controls in their ability to inhibit responses that lead to aversive consequences. In a study designed to test avoidance learning in Ps, a group of incarcerated male criminals were screened for psychopathy, and the ones that were identified as Ps were recruited to participate in the study.

Five of the numbers were associated with reward, such that pressing the button after the presentation of these five numbers resulted in the participant receiving a monetary incentive.

With regard to patients who perceive their condition as unmodifiable, this theory hypothesizes that increasing the patients’ self-efficacy will change how the patients perceive their condition and, therefore, increase adherence to treatment.\nIn addition to self-efficacy, according to SCT, individuals’ beliefs regarding whether their behaviors will lead to positive and negative outcomes also motivate behavior.

Autonomous motivation refers to self-initiating behaviors that are tied to one’s values and goals. SDT differentiates between autonomously motivated behaviors and controlled behaviors. Controlled behaviors are performed due to pressure from social contacts (external motivation) or due to internal psychological pressures, such as guilt or fear (introjected motivation).

Researchers investigated whether the self-enhancement gained by the tendency to favor one’s in-group over his or her out-group would influence the person’s decision for selecting dispositional rather than situational causes for a target’s behavior. Surveys were mailed to 398 employees of an organization who were classified as either managers or assistants. The survey was returned by 42% of the sample (64 managers and 104 assistants).\nThe survey consisted of four scenarios describing the behavior of a hypothetical target employee in a company attempting to address a common office situation. In-group and out-group bias was manipulated by alternately describing the target employee as either a manager or as an assistant. The target’s behavior was described as having either a positive or negative outcome. The positive outcomes represented favorable behaviors such as competence and success (“The employee corrected a major error in a report on time.”). The negative outcomes represented unfavorable behaviors such as incompetence and failure (“The employee was unable to reach a decision.”). For each scenario, participants were asked to determine whether the cause of the target’s behavior was either dispositional or situational.\nOverall, participants indicated that the cause of the target’s behavior was due to dispositional rather than situational factors. However, results differed when group membership and the outcomes of the behaviors were taken into account.

    "your_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The solution is A.\nThe passage indicates that the early studies found that as an individual’s attraction to the group decreased, the individual’s degree of opinion change also decreased. This type of relationship between two variables is a positive (or direct) correlation in which the values of both variables change in the same direction. As variable X increases, variable Y increases, and vice versa.\nIn a negative (or inverse) correlation, the values of both variables change in opposite directions. As variable X increases, variable Y decreases, and vice versa.\nThe observed relationship between an individual’s attraction to the group and degree of opinion change can be interpreted as a correlation. However, there is no indication that either of these variables was systematically manipulated as an independent variable in an experiment. Thus, no cause-and-effect relationship can be inferred from the passage.\nThe passage provided no indication that the early studies that found the relationship between individual attraction to the group and degree of opinion change were experimental. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that the research described in the passage established that changes to either of these variables caused the observed changes to the other variable.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

    "passage": "Passage 6 (Questions 29-32)\nThe General Aggression Model (GAM) was proposed to explain the relationship between exposure to violent media (for example, violent TV shows, movies, or video games) and aggressive behavior. The GAM suggests that situational variables have an impact on aggressive behavior by influencing a person’s internal states, which are composed of cognitive states, affective states, and physiological arousal. These internal states interact with each other and influence the individual’s responses to situational variables. This interactive approach accounts for differences in how individuals respond to the same stimuli.\nFor instance, a situational variable may be a classmate bumping into a child. If this incident primes aggressive thoughts (for example, “He bumped into me on purpose”), this may lead to aggressive affect (for example, frustration) and increased physiological arousal, which can lead to impulsive or aggressive behaviors. It is also possible that a child who is already in an aggressive affective state or is experiencing heightened physiological arousal may be more likely to interpret accidental bumping as an intentional assault.\nAccording to the GAM, violent media can act as a situational variable that influences the individual’s internal state. Watching violence can directly prime aggressive thoughts by making them available. Alternatively, watching violence can indirectly prime aggressive thoughts by altering individuals’ affective or physiological states in a way that makes aggressive thoughts more likely.\nExposure to violent media can also have long-term effects through learning. Specifically, repeated exposure can lead to the observation and reinforcement of aggressive behaviors, the storage of aggressive knowledge structures (such as aggressive expectations or aggressive behavior scripts), and losing responsiveness to aggression.\nStudies on the effects of violent media on aggression have been experimental, cross-sectional, and longitudinal. Experimental studies focus on laboratory measures of aggression, such as punishment delivered to an opponent. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies focus on “real world” aggression, such as assault or criminal behavior. Despite differences in their measures, the three types of research point to a strong positive correlation between exposure to violent media and aggressive behavior.\n    Adapted from C. A.

    "passage": "Passage 6 (Questions 29-32)\nThe General Aggression Model (GAM) was proposed to explain the relationship between exposure to violent media (for example, violent TV shows, movies, or video games) and aggressive behavior. The GAM suggests that situational variables have an impact on aggressive behavior by influencing a person’s internal states, which are composed of cognitive states, affective states, and physiological arousal. These internal states interact with each other and influence the individual’s responses to situational variables. This interactive approach accounts for differences in how individuals respond to the same stimuli.\nFor instance, a situational variable may be a classmate bumping into a child. If this incident primes aggressive thoughts (for example, “He bumped into me on purpose”), this may lead to aggressive affect (for example, frustration) and increased physiological arousal, which can lead to impulsive or aggressive behaviors. It is also possible that a child who is already in an aggressive affective state or is experiencing heightened physiological arousal may be more likely to interpret accidental bumping as an intentional assault.\nAccording to the GAM, violent media can act as a situational variable that influences the individual’s internal state. Watching violence can directly prime aggressive thoughts by making them available. Alternatively, watching violence can indirectly prime aggressive thoughts by altering individuals’ affective or physiological states in a way that makes aggressive thoughts more likely.\nExposure to violent media can also have long-term effects through learning. Specifically, repeated exposure can lead to the observation and reinforcement of aggressive behaviors, the storage of aggressive knowledge structures (such as aggressive expectations or aggressive behavior scripts), and losing responsiveness to aggression.\nStudies on the effects of violent media on aggression have been experimental, cross-sectional, and longitudinal. Experimental studies focus on laboratory measures of aggression, such as punishment delivered to an opponent. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies focus on “real world” aggression, such as assault or criminal behavior. Despite differences in their measures, the three types of research point to a strong positive correlation between exposure to violent media and aggressive behavior.\n    Adapted from C. A.

Compared to young women, young men report drinking more often, as well as consuming more alcohol on occasions when they drink. Some researchers suspect that gender differences in alcohol consumption could be related to gender role attitudes.\nIn a particular study, researchers hypothesized that traditional gender attitudes increase alcohol consumption in young men, while such attitudes reduce consumption in young women. To test this hypothesis, the researchers examined the role of gender attitudes in the frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption in a representative sample of 1488 women and men between the ages of 17 to 30 in the United States. Gender role attitudes were measured by coding respondents’ level of agreement or disagreement with statements that assert beliefs about gender and family life, resulting in scores for each respondent on a gender role attitude scale.\nThe study also examined the impact of entry into adult roles (such as employment, marriage, and parenthood) on alcohol consumption. The researchers hypothesized that women’s younger average age of marriage and parenthood contribute to women having lower alcohol consumption compared to men. They found that employment increased the amount of drinking among male respondents, but decreased it among female respondents.

Since women still consume less alcohol than men, regardless of psychosocial factors, then it would suggest that a factor such as differences in hormone levels might account for the behavioral difference.\nThis option provides a result with an alternative factor that could explain the influence of gender on alcohol consumption. If men and women with similar attitudes and roles still consume similar amounts of alcohol, then the testosterone hypothesis can be questioned. With this finding, it would be attitudes and roles that impact consumption levels (not just hormones).\nKhan Academy Lessons",

Regardless of the debate over causes, studies have suggested that childhood mental health conditions have greater long-term impact on adult socioeconomic status (SES) than childhood physical health conditions.\nStudy 1\nResearchers combined data from the U.S. Panel Study of Income Dynamics, which collects information on education, income, work, and marriage, with a retrospective child health history. The health history asked participants to report physical illnesses, such as asthma, or psychological disorders, such as depression, that they experienced before the age of 18. Statistical analyses revealed that retrospective reports of depressive symptoms or alcohol dependence were associated with lower income during adulthood.

Although commonly prescribed in HICs, use of antidepressant medications may not be supported by sufficient evidence to justify the cost in LMICs (unless generic antidepressants are available).\nThe prevalence of dementia is higher in HICs than in LMICs, which is likely because of underreporting in LMICs. Thus, raising public awareness of dementia through community-based programs, along with regular review of detected cases, are recommended for improving dementia surveillance.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "your_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The solution is A.\nDementia is an abnormal condition, and not an inevitable result of normal aging. Making people aware of this fact may help alleviate the problem of underreporting of dementia in LMICs, mentioned in the passage.\nListing all the disorders involving dementia would not be helpful, because Alzheimer’s Disease is the cause of most dementia cases. In addition, such a program may lead to increased levels of stigmatization of persons with dementia, which could, in turn, bring about increased underreporting of dementia in LMICs.\nInforming people about the distinction between fluid and crystallized intelligence is unlikely to raise public awareness of dementia. Declines in fluid intelligence can be expected to occur as a normal result of aging, rather than an abnormal condition.\nInforming people about the distinction between decay and interference is unlikely to raise public awareness of dementia, because that distinction is not clearly relevant to dementia.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

Research suggests that this health disparity may be partly related to differences in the rate of breast cancer screening. As a result, studies have been conducted to identify factors that are associated with mammography usage.\nUsing a sample of approximately 2500 respondents, researchers explored the relationship between social capital and mammography usage among African American women. Data were derived from a random digit dialing telephone survey of adults living in a major metropolitan area of the United States. Survey questions asked respondents to self-report on a range of health topics, including women’s usage of mammography. The researchers were interested in the association between social capital and the odds of having had a mammogram in the past year.\nSocial capital was operationalized by dividing it into three component measures: collective efficacy, social cohesion, and social participation. Collective efficacy assessed respondents’ perception that members of their community were likely to help one another out.

    "explanation": "The solution is B.\nSocial cohesion was close to 1.00 and not statistically significant, suggesting that there was no relationship between that component of social capital and the likelihood of mammography.\nCollective efficacy is the only component of social capital in the table that is statistically significant (indicated by an asterisk). In addition to that information, the odds ratio of 1.40 suggests that increases in collective efficacy were associated with an increased likelihood of having had a mammogram (the passage provides information on interpreting the odds ratio).\nSocial participation was close to 1.00 and not statistically significant, suggesting that there was no relationship between that component of social capital and the likelihood of mammography. In addition, social cohesion was close to 1.00 and not statistically significant, suggesting that there was no relationship between that component of social capital and the likelihood of mammography. Thus, neither component is likely to affect mammography usage.\nSocial participation was close to 1.00 and not statistically significant, suggesting that there was no relationship between that component of social capital and the likelihood of mammography. Although collective efficacy likely affected mammography usage, this option is ruled out because of the conclusion about social participation not affecting mammography.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

    "passage": "Passage 10 (Questions 53-56)\nAfrican American women have a higher rate of breast cancer mortality than other racial/ethnic groups in the United States. Research suggests that this health disparity may be partly related to differences in the rate of breast cancer screening. As a result, studies have been conducted to identify factors that are associated with mammography usage.\nUsing a sample of approximately 2500 respondents, researchers explored the relationship between social capital and mammography usage among African American women. Data were derived from a random digit dialing telephone survey of adults living in a major metropolitan area of the United States. Survey questions asked respondents to self-report on a range of health topics, including women’s usage of mammography. The researchers were interested in the association between social capital and the odds of having had a mammogram in the past year.\nSocial capital was operationalized by dividing it into three component measures: collective efficacy, social cohesion, and social participation. Collective efficacy assessed respondents’ perception that members of their community were likely to help one another out. Social cohesion addressed the degree to which respondents identified with the values in their community. Social participation determined how active the respondents were in their community. The researchers also analyzed various socioeconomic variables, including whether a respondent had health insurance and whether a respondent’s income was below the federal poverty level.\nTable 1 displays the likelihood of mammography based on a selection of socioeconomic and social capital variables (likelihood is expressed as an odds ratio, which indicates increased likelihood for values over 1.00 and decreased likelihood for values below 1.00).\nTable 1 Likelihood of Mammography by Selected Variables\nVariable Odds Ratio for Mammogram 95% Confidence Interval\nHealth insurance 2.29* 1.57–3.33\nBelow poverty level 0.68* 0.47–0.98\nSocial cohesion 1.00 0.95–1.06\nCollective efficacy 1.40* 1.05–1.85\nSocial participation 1.05 0.96–1.15\nNote: * indicates a statistically significant result at p < 0.05.\nThe researchers suggested that future studies should continue to explore how perceptions of social capital might affect individual health preventive behaviors such as mammography.

    "answer_choices": "A. Patients whose healthcare provider is from the same racial/ethnic group will have above average rates of mammography.\nB. Mammography rates will be affected by healthcare providers who interact with patients differently according to racial/ethnic group.\nC. Metropolitan areas that are highly segregated across different racial/ethnic groups will have below average rates of mammography.\nD. Mammography rates will be affected by healthcare policies that have a disproportionate impact on racial/ethnic minority groups.",
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "your_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The solution is D.\nThis option suggests racial concordance in healthcare interactions.\nThis option suggests individual discrimination during interactions.\nThis option is more directly related to residential segregation by race/ethnicity. Although discrimination and segregation are commonly discussed together, from a sociological perspective they can be distinguished from one another. Segregation refers to separation in physical space, whereas discrimination describes unfair treatment.\nThe passage refers to research suggesting that the breast cancer mortality disparity may be partly related to differences in cancer screening with mammography. The question introduces another researcher’s alternative hypothesis, proposing that the correct answer must apply the concept of institutional discrimination. Institutional discrimination calls attention to policies at the organizational or institutional level in health care. Rather than being directly exclusionary, these policies tend to have a disproportionate impact on certain groups.\nKhan Academy Lessons",

The theory suggests that social relationships are fundamental for individuals to develop a sense of who they are.\nContemplation is an internal process, lacking the element of social interactions or relationships that are central to symbolic interactionism.\nCultural assimilation is related to identity, but more specifically refers to the process by which an immigrant group adopts the dominant group’s cultural norms and values.\nTherapy, even in a group setting, is not the primary way that identity is formed.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "your_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The solution is A.\nAuditory hair cells are a type of mechanoreceptor. Auditory hair cells deflect when the sound signal is transduced into vibrations in the inner ear. The auditory hair cells (such as stereocilia) bend towards the tallest stereocilium and connect to mechanically gated ion channels.\nProprioceptors are a type of sensor that helps an individual to determine the location of a body part and/or its position. These receptors are found within the vestibular system, muscles, and/or tendons.\nChemoreceptors are specialized receptors that transduce chemical signals and generate an output. The auditory hair cells are not chemoreceptors. Chemoreceptors are found in the carotid bodies and the aortic arch.\nOsmoreceptors are usually located in the hypothalamus and they usually detect the change in osmotic pressures. These receptors are not located in the auditory system.\nKhan Academy Lessons",
